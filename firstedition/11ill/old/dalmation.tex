The ability to perceive common texture elements presented
separately to the two eyes is remarkable.
Texture generally is an important clue to grouping
and segregating objects from the background.
The classic figure of a Dalmation dog drinking from a stream
illustrates how much information we can extract from texture
without very little object-specific edge information.
Whatever that means.
