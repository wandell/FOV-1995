Not done in primate.
Peter Sterling had a couple of papers about this in late 80s
in various places--about cat retina. I could look it up
if you need it. Heinz Wassle also---but both used fairly
qualitative measures of receptive field size.
I've been wondering if the structure/function correspondence
may have been overdone because of evidence that is beginning
to emerge about coupling between ganglion cells.

Nice to see you at ARVO.
