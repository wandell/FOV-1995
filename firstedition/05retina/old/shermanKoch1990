Although most of the retinal ganglion cell outputs go to
the lateral geniculate, only 10-20 percent of the synapses
within the cat lateral geniculate come from retinal axons.
These are far outnumbered by
synapses from the cortex;
there are nearly an order of magnitude
more axons projecting from cortex
to lateral geniculate than the
in the reverse direction.
(Sherman and Koch, 1990).
