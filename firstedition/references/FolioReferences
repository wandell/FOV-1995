Brian,
No, we haven't done anything in Folio to support the BibTeX format,
I'm afraid.

The only support we've provided directly in Folio for exporting
citations is the EXPORT display, which uses 2-character tags
that some personal bibliography software packages recognize.
Specifically, it was first developed for use with EndNote.
(If you haven't already, type HELP EXPORT in Folio for more details
about this.)

This tag set was developed by the people in UC's Division
of Library Automation, for use in several of the MELVYL databases.
I believe it is recognized by several bibliographic software packages.
In MELVYL, some of the relevant help screens are available via:
     EXP DOWNLOAD            EXP TAGS
     SHOW BIBL SOFTWARE

Hello,

I am preparing a bibliography for a book using LaTex.  I am writing to ask
whether there are any programs or methods available for converting
the reference format you provide when I do folio searches into the
conventional BibTeX format?

Thanks for your help.
