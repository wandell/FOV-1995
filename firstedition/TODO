Hi Brian,

Thanks for your speedy replies. A few more questions in that area, then I'm 
coding it for Paul and letting go.

Gibson, '62 ref. Your title reads, "Visual mechanisms in a 
cone-monochromat." Is that the complete title, and NOTE: can I have the vol. 
and pages, too???
	Sent ....

Rushton, 1962 No problem changing ref to the reprint you used, but I need 
the pub date of the edited text.
	Sent ....


Polyak ref. I dropped the long title, but will need the title of Kluver's 
book, and the pages, if possible.
	OK, explained

The Mollon et al., 1980 ref (page 2 of my fax) Can you provide pages? Also, 
want to confirm that title is correct. There is a Moreland 82 ref that cites 
Verriest as editor of "Colour Deficiencies" Two different books????
	Explained

Please provide correct spelling for Parkinnen. One "k" and two "n's"??
	two ks.


Too bad about the Gouras and Evers ref. It is cited once in text. Just kill 
the ref? Not sure if I can kill it in text at this point without creating a 
major problem. Have not received pages yet.

	We changed to Gouras The Perception of Color

Will enter change to figure 4.11. I assume there is room for add'l text.


Cheers,

K

Hi Kathaleen,


The ones that I couldn't deal with are shown with a "*".  There are 4
of them. I don't quite know what to do, but I think the book can go
forward even if those pages are missing.  Don't you?

Anyway, let me know what else I should do.  I teach from 9:30 - 11
tomorrow, but I will be around after that (and before).

*58.  Zeki 1990

	I can't find this one anywhere.  Can we delete?
	Or, if we figure out where it came from, maybe I
	can substitute in another Zeki.

59.  Zeki date on this one is 1973.

	Loose ends:

Lose the Perry reference.  The CIE reference is referenced just as I
have given it to you.  Nothing to add.  It is, however, an important
reference.








Hi Kathaleen,

In general, the references are right and the text was my hallucination
at the time I was writing.  I tried to be careful about getting the
proper reference.  I indicate that to you below when I say "You
are right," meaning that the guess you made about the reference
entry does correspond properly to the citation I meant in the text.

Hi Brian,

Don't faint, this isn't so bad. Unfortunately, I don't have pages to work 
from, only galleys, so I can't provide a page number for you. Sorry.

Here is the Ch. 2 info:

Campbell and Gubisch, 1967. I have 1966 in my refs.
	The 1966 in the refs is correct.

Williams et al., 1995. I have 1994 in refs.
	The 1994 in refs is correct.

Westheimer, 1984. (Fig. 2.15) Not in refs.
	This should be the 1986 reference.  In fact, my
	Figures are numbered differently and 1986 is in my
	pages.

Helmholtz, 1909 (Footnote 7) That year not in refs.

	I think we need to adjust the Helmholtz references
	throughout.  I have a copy of his book, and here
	are the facts.  Perhaps you can put them into a proper
	reference format:

	Original German:

	H. von Helmholtz
	Handbuch der Physiolgischen Optic
	Voss, 1909.

	The printing I have (and we use in the US):

	Edited by J. SOuthall and Translated
	from the Third German Edition.  It is called
	Helmholtz' Tretise on PHysiological Optics.
	The publisher of the translation is Dover.
	It was first published in 1962 as an unabridged and
	corrected republication of the English tranlation first published
	by the Optical Society of America in 1924.


	Now what?

Yellott et al., 1981. I have only Yellott et al., 1984.
	This should be 1984

Yellott et al., 1980 (Exercise #3) Not in refs.
	This should be the et al., 1984

Ch. 3 info:


Campbell and Gubisch, '67. I have 66
	Right, '66.

Schwartz, 1978. I have 1967
	I think you have 1977.  And this is the one.

	E. A. Schwartz (1977) Voltage noise observed in rods of the turtle
	retina.  J. Physiol. v. 272, p. 217-246.

Baylor et al., 1987. I have a Baylor et al. in refs waiting for a date.
	This is a Baylor

D. A. Baylor, B. J. Nunn, J. L. Schnapf 1987
Spectral sensitivity of cones of the monkey Macaca Fascicularis
J. Physio. 
v. 390
pp. 145-160


Stockman and Macleod, '93 (Fig. 3.3) I have Stockman et al., 1993.
	That is correct.

DeMonasterio et al., 1981. I have only 1985.
	That is correct.

LeGrand, 1935. I have 1937 in my refs.
	That is correct.

Williams, 1985. Should be "a" or "b"
	Can you tell me more about where this reference is
	located?

Bowmaker and Mollon, '93. I have Mollon and Bowmaker, '92 in refs.
	That is right.

Chapter 4

Newton, Opticks. Not in refs. No date in galleys, either.

	Again, this is the 1704 I sent you in the last message.

James Clerk Maxwell, (Exercise #9) not in refs.
	J. C. Maxwell 1855
	Experiments on colour, as perceive by the eye,
	with remarks on colour-blindness,
	Trans. Roy .Soc. Edin., v. 21, p. 275-298, reprinted in
	Scientific Papers, W. D. Niven (ed.), Dover, New York


And that is it for Chs.1 - 4. Not bad at all.


I think that leaves me with 8, 10, and 11, which I will do post-haste, 
because I have to finish the refs by Tuesday at the very latest....


The end is in sight, the end is in sight, the end......zzzz

Hi Kathaleen,

Here are some responses to your queries about the Chapter 9 references.

brian
------



P. 285, Fig. 9.3 Newton, 1704. Not in refs
	This is Newton's Opticks
	A reference is
	Newton (1704).  Opticks.  London, Smith and Walford.

P. 286, Nayar, 1993. I have Nayar and Bolle, '93 in refs.
	Yes, that is it.

P. 290, Cohen, 1970. No Cohen, 1970 in refs.
	This should be the Cohen 1964

P. 293, Sastri, 1965. I have Sastri and et al., 1965 in refs.
	This should be Sastri and Das, 1965

P. 295, Farrell et al., 1993. Not in refs.
	This should be the ref I sent

	That'll screw up some paging.

P. 305. von Kries, 1902, 1905. Refs have a 1970 date (Fr. MacAdam's text); 
what to do with these???

	That's fine.

P. 314, Chichilnisky, '95. I have Chi. and Wandell, '95.
	This should be

	E. J. Chichilnisky (1995)
	Perceptual Measurements of neural computations
	 in color appearance
	Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford University.

	Perhaps some University Microfilms citation?

P. 315, Wandell, '86. Not in refs.
	This should be the Wandell, 1985, reference

	Svaetichin and MacNichol it is.

P. 318, Buchsbaum and Gottschalk, 1986. I have a 1984, but no 1986.
	1984 it is.

P. 319, B & G, '86, Same as above.
	Right.

P. 323, Zeki, 1990 (Text and Footnote). Have 2 in refs. need a's and b's.

	That's correct.

P. 328, Burkhalter, 1989. I have only Burkhalter et al., '89 in refs.
	That's correct.

P. 328, Deyoe and Van Essen, 1994. Not in refs. I do have Deyoe et al., '94 
in refs.
	The et al. is correct.

P. 329, Zeki, 1990. Needs a/b
	Make this a and b.

P. 333, Mollon, 1979. Refs have Stiles, 1978, no editor named.....
	You have the right reference.  Mollon put the volume

	We should delete Mollon's name from there.  He had the
	idea for the book, but on examining the book I now see
	that he is not author or editor or anything.

Three captions to Pete

Fig 5.4 Legend
--------------

A ROD-INITIATED PATHWAY in the vertebrate retina.  Axons from more
than 1000 rods converge upon a single rod bipolar cell (RB).  The rod
bipolars send their outputs to a specialized amacrine cell, the AII,
located in the inner plexiform layer.  The AII amacrine cell
communicates the rod-initiated signal to two types of ganglion cells,
one whose dendritic field is in the upper layers of the inner
plexiform layer and another whose dendritic field is in the lower
layers.  Ganglion cells with dendritic fields in the upper layer also
receive input from OFF-center bipolar cells (OFF B); ganglion cells
whose dendritic fields are in the lower layer also receive input from
ON-center bipolar cells (ON B). Source: Boycott and W\"assle (1991).

Figure 5.7 Legend
-----------------

DENDRITIC FIELD SIZE AS A FUNCTION OF ECCENTRICITY in the human
retina.  The graph shows the dendritic field size of midget and
parasol neurons.  Filled symbols represent neurons in the nasal retina
and open symbols represent neurons in the temporal retina.  The
dendritic field size increases with eccentricity for both types of
neurons, but at each eccentricity the sizes are easily classified.

Figure 5.9 Legend
-----------------

THE LATERAL GENICULATE NUCLEUS is located in a region of the brain
called the thalamus.  In the primate, the majority of retinal ganglion
cell axons terminate in this nucleus.  When stained with Golgi
material, the nucleus appears to have six separate layers.  The four
superficial layers have neurons with small cell bodies and are called
the parvocellular layers.  The two deep layers have neurons with large
cell bodies and are called the magnocellular layers.  There are also
cell bodies that fall between these layers in regions called the
intercalated zones.  Each layer contains a map of the visual field,
and these maps are in register.  Hence, the LGN neurons located near
the radial arrow respond to stimuli at a common location in the visual
field.

Figure 5.16
-----------

THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL STEADY-STATE CONTRAST RESPONSE of a primate
retinal ganglion cell.  When a neuron's response to contrast patterns
is linear, we can measure a system-matrix that maps the stimulus
contrast of one-dimensional patterns into the change in firing rate of
the neuron.  The curve, which is a graphical representation of the
system matrix, represents the neuron's one-dimensional steady-state
receptive field.





Hi Kathaleen:

Here is a start on some of the corrections for the references.
What a royal pain this stuff is.  I sure hope somebody reads this book
to make all this worthwhile.
