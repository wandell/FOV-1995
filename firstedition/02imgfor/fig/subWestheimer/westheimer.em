Subject: Re:  question about linespread functions ...
Status: R

Dear Brian:
	I used Gubisch's data of the line-spread function and had
an engineering student spend several days fitting an equation to
them.  The equation is relatively easy to use in calculations and
hugs the data well.
	For the point-spread function we did the inverse job:
what function, when integrated from plus to minus infinity will
yield the empirical line-spread function.  These functions
are probably an over-estimate of the actual retinal spread, but
they are near enough to provide a conservative estimate of
what is going on.
	Best regards
					Gerald.
