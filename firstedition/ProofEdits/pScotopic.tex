The system matrix, call it $\Scotopic$, must have one row and $\nl$
columns.  The test light, system matrix, and primary intensity are
related by the product, $e = \Scotopic \test$.  We can write this
matrix equation using a {\bf matrix tableau} representation.  This
representation indicates the general shapes of the vectors and matrices
and is often a helpful method for understanding their shapes and
inter-relationships.  The matrix tableau that represents the scotopic
system matrix is:
\begin{equation}
  \left ( e \right ) =
  \left ( 
%    \mbox{``Scotopic matching system matrix''}
     r_1 ~~~ r_2 ~~~ \ldots ~~~ r_{{\nl}-1}~~~ r_{\nl}
  \right )
  \left (
   \begin{array}{c}
    \testi{1} \\
    \testi{2} \\
    \vdots \\
    \testi{\nl-1} \\
    \testi{\nl} \\
   \end{array}
  \right )
\end{equation}

We can also write the matrix product $\Scotopic \test$
as a summation over the sample wavelengths,
\begin{equation}
\label{e2:sm}
e = \sum_{i=1}^{i=\nl} \Scotopici{i} \testi{i} 
\end{equation}

We can relate the measurements in the scotopic matching experiment to
the entries of the system matrix as follows.  Suppose we use a
monochromatic test light of unit intensity,
