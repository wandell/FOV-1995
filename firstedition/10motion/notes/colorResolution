Why do the color pathways with poor
spatial resolution also have poor temporal resolution?
Perhaps the reason is that
moving objects are the most important dynamic stimulus.
The temporal frequencies in the retinal image of a moving
object are limited by the spatial frequency in the image.
For example, consider the temporal response at a single
cone by two targets, moving at the same velocity, 1 degree per second.
A 1 cpd target moving at 1 degree per second generates a flickering
signal at 1 Hz.  
A 10 cpd target, moving at the same speed,
generates a flickering signal at 10 Hz.

Based on this correlation in the signal,
we should expect
behavioral temporal resolution to correlate with spatial resolution.
The most extreme example, as usual, are the $\Blue$ cones.
The chromatic aberration of the lens limits the
spatial  frequency range available
to the $\Blue$ cones compared
to the $\Red$ and $\Green$ cones.
Since the $\Blue$ cone signal has a very low spatial resolution,
signals initiated by the $\Blue$ cones
will experience lower frequency signals
than the $\Red$ or $\Green$ cones.
Oddly, then, because of spatial blurring
the $\Blue$ cone-initiated pathways
generally will experience lower temporal rates than
the $\Red$ and $\Green$ cone initiated pathways.
The $\Blue$ cone pathways may
have poor temporal resolution because
the motion signals on this pathway are also limited.
