a\nocite{FreemanMitchellMillodot}	%astigmatism
Freeman, Mitchell and Millodot (1972) studied
subjects with pronounced astigmatism 
and found that {\em neural sensitivity} in different orientations
depends on early experience.
Even when vision was corrected for the optical astigmatism,
subjects still had poor visual resolution.
This experiment shows that
the quality of the visual input provided by the optics
can modify the neural development within the visual pathways.
