Saccades also influence other aspects of visibility.  For example, Li
and Matin (1990) have described experiments in which they show that
observers cannot detect very large displacements of the visual field
during eye movements.  By comparison, during steady fixation, we can
detect displacements as small as a minute of arc or less.  Li and
Matin (1990) and Bridgeman and Fisher (1990) show that subjects cannot
detect target displacements of several degrees while executing a
saccade.
