The numbers you gave about the fovea (Brief Organised List: Retina 5) 
seemed wrong to me, but I am no expert, so I consulted Adriana 
Fiorenetini, who is. She consulted a  paper by Curcio et al (J 
Comp Neurol 292:497 (1990)), the most recent giving detailed data about 
photorecptors in the human retina..


She tells me: The diameter of the fovea is hard to be sure of, but is 
probably greater than 1.5 mm.

              The diameter of the rod-free zone 0.35 mm (1.25 deg.), not 
0.5 mm.

She also tells me the peak cone density per mm^2 is 1.9x10^5 not 1.6x10^5.



Since your list is likely to be widely used, I thought I should let you 
know.

Thanks for your insights, Brian. I by-and-large agree with
your line of thinking. However, I would still like to get
a bound for how many "operations" are performed for a
"visual task". If only I could remove those quotation marks.
It would be nice to have some time constants in your
list of useful numbers.

	I'm not perseverative, and this really is a wild coincidence, but 
Ted Sharpe and I are doing a paper together for which we need to know the 
number of blue cones.

	Ted says there are about 600,000 the ratio of R+G to B being 6-10 
to one. You give 100 to one.

	Who's right?

	ciao
