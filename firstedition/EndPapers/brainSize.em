TITLE:           Correlated size variations in human visual cortex, lateral
                   geniculate nucleus, and optic tract.

ABSTRACT:  We have examined several components of the human visual system to
   determine how the dimensions of the optic tract, lateral geniculate nucleus
   (LGN), and primary visual cortex (V1) vary within the same brain.
   Measurements were made of the cross-sectional area of the optic tract, the
   volumes of the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the LGN, and the
   surface area and volume of V1 in one or both cerebral hemispheres of 15
   neurologically normal human brains obtained at autopsy. Consistent with
   previous observations, there was a two- to threefold variation in the size
   of each of these visual components among the individuals studied.
   Importantly, this variation was coordinated within the visual system of any
   one individual. That is, a relatively large V1 was associated with a
   commensurately large LGN and optic tract, whereas a relatively small V1 was
   associated with a commensurately smaller LGN and optic tract. This
   relationship among the components of the human visual system indicates that
   the development of its different parts is interdependent. Such coordinated
   variation should generate substantial differences in visual ability among
   humans.
