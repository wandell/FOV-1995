\subsection*{Absolute sensitivity}

\be
\item Minimum number of absorptions for: scotopic detection 1-5;
detectable excitation of a rod 1; photopic detection 10-15
% Wandell

\item Dark adaptation: photopic 10 minutes; scotopic 40 minutes
%Tyler, Wooding

\item Range of visual sensitivity from very bright background
to dark adaptation:  5 log units
%Ross

\item For extended stimuli spatial extended stimuli, foveal
detection threshold occurs at an average of 1 quantum per cone 
%Tyler
