ABSTRACT:  The representation of the visual field in areas V3 and V4 of the
   macaque was mapped with multiunit electrodes. Twelve Macaca fascicularis
   were studied in repeated recording sessions while immobilized and
   anesthetized. V3 is a narrow strip (4-5 mm wide) of myeloarchitectonically
   distinct cortex located immediately anterior to V2. It contains a systematic
   representation of the central 35-40.degree. of the contralateral visual
   field; the representation of the upper quadrant is located ventrally in the
   hemisphere and that of the lower quadrant, dorsally. There is a small gap
   between the dorsal (V3d) and ventral (V3v) portions of V3. The
   representation of the horizontal meridian is adjacent to that in V2 and
   forms the posterior border of both V3d and V3v. Most or all of the anterior
   border of V3d consists of the representation of the lower vertical meridian.
   The entire anterior border of V3v consists of the representation of the
   upper vertical meridian. V4 is a strip of myeloarchitectonically distinct
   cortex 5-8 mm wide, immediately anterior to V3. It contains a coarse, but
   systematic, representation of approximately the central 35-40.degree. of the
   contralateral visual field. The representation of the upper visual field is
   located ventrally in the hemisphere. Most of the representation of the lower
   visual field is located dorsally. The posterior border of V4 corresponds to
   the representation of the vertical meridian, and the representation of the
   horizontal meridian is located at or near  its anterior border. In both V3
   and V4, the representation of the central visual field is magnified relative
   to that of the periphery. In both areas, the size of receptive fields
   increases with increasing eccentricity; however, at a given eccentricity,
   the receptive fields of V4 are larger than those of V3.
