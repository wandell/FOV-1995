Not V5, no. There is extrageniculate thalamic input via pulvinar.
V2 and V4 do receive some geniculate input (I recall a figure of 0.1%
of LGN cells projecting there). That projection may be quite
important, however, for reasons I don't have time to articulate right
now ...

Actually, I think you're being rather charitable. You have omitted
Ferster (1981), who says that all of the others are wrong, and that
cats are really just like Poggio's monkeys (near, far, TE amd TI
cells), except even Poggio now says that monkeys aren't really like
that.

Explain this: six weeks ago your only treatment of stereopsis was a
snippet dropped into the middle of the motion chapter. Now you're into
this??? Go take a cold shower.

Brian:

In response to Bill's goading on the MT/V5 issue, I have actually
firmed up a little on the V5 side of the argument. Here's the
reasoning as I expressed it to Bill:

>From Bill:

Really, the only good reason not to use V5 is that Zeki prefers it.
It's objectively silly and confusing to use a geographical name based
on a different species just because we happen to believe there's a
homology. I think it's arguable that MT should be reserved for its
original owl monkey definition and V5 should be used for macaques.

But what I told Brian is that the whole nomenclature business in
extrastriate cortex is a total mess, and that there are really no good
choices.

Bill, Brian:

It is on the face of it odd that stereopsis has not been studied much
in developmentally abnormal monkeys. But there are several good
reasons:

 + studying stereopsis in monkeys is quite difficult; unlike spatial
   tasks -- which they learn quickly and happily -- monkeys seem very
   averse to learning stereo tasks. Some of this may have to do with
   the difficulty of obtaining binocular alignment in haploscopic
   displays (see more below)

 + almost any manipulation that reduces cortical binoculariy affects
   eye alignment. Thus Brian is incorrect when he says that alternate
   occlusion animals are better than strabismics for this test,
   because alternate occlusion causes strabismus. So does monocular
   deprivation, which is useless for this anyway because it is not
   of interest to study stereopsis in an animal that only has one
   functional eye. The result is that failing to find stereopsis is
   a weak result in the absence of objective evidence that the targets
   were actually presented to the appropriate retinal locations. This
   is difficult in cooperative human subjects trained to use Nonius
   markers; it would be all but impossible in monkeys. Thus a negative
   result is almost uninterpretable.

 + the loss of stereopsis is not a particularly important visual
   dysfunction. Amblyopia is a much more serious problem, and much
   more in the NEI's interest.

Now, on the MT/V5 issue, the balance hinges on how you feel about
homology. As Bill knows, I am not a fan of comparative neurology, and
I regard most debates about homology as empty. These debates will
continue, however, and I think it is possible that one day we will
find out that owl monkeys and macaques are not quite the same in their
cortical organization, and that we will have the awkward situation of
having the same name for two different structures. The Vn nomanclature
seems to me agnostic on the issue of hierarchy; it simply says that
this area is the fifth topographic map in the visual pathway, starting
with V1 (for which, I must concede, it's clear that the same name
should be used for all species). It doesn't say it's the fifth rung of
a hierarchical ladder.

In a not very powerful sort of way, yes. No one doubts that binocular
neurons are basic to stereopsis (in the same sense that cones are
basic to vision). Showing that stereopsis goes away when they go away
is sort of trivial (especially when the animal can only see out of one
eye anyway!).

Somewhat better evidence comes from experiments on alternate monocular
occlusion and/or squint, in which stereopsis goes away despite being
able to show that the animal can see with either eye. You can find
references in my old Ann Rev Psych chapter (81), or I'll dig them out
for you if you don't have that to hand. Hirsch did some stuff, so did
Gordon, so did Mitchell.

There is no general agreement on that point, but it is the claim in
the Blasdel papers (1992, J Neurosci), a claim at least partly
supported by the evidence.
