The pattern adaptation experiments are interesting,
and the effects are powerful.
But to argue that multiresolution theories
are important in normal visual processing,
we must look for
internal consistencies within many psychophysical
experiments.
These consistencies must be measured, not postulated.
Figure \ref{f6:AdaptationDetection} illustrates one of
the challenges any general theory of visual organization
must confront.

We began this chapter by considering threshold sensitivity,
without any consideration of the pattern adaptation experiment.
Now, we are using data from the pattern
adaptation experiment to draw conclusions about the detection experiments.
Implicit in this argument 
is the assumption that the
visual mechanisms that limit detection
are the same
mechanisms that change sensitivity in pattern adaptation.
But we have no direct evidence that the neurons
that limit sensitivity at
the same neurons that underly adaptation.
The diagram in Figure \ref{f6:AdaptationDetection} 
illustrates one way in which this assumption may fail.

The visual pathways consists of
a series of neural stages.
Suppose that the group of neurons
at the stage marked by "T" in the figure are particularly
noisy and insensitive compared to neurons at later stages.
If these are the least sensitive
and reliable neurons in the pathway,
the observer's sensitivity to the target will be
limited by their performance.
Properties of the experiment
that improve the signal-to-noise
ratio of these neural elements will also improve
the observer's overall performance.
For example, spatial patterns that are well-matched to the
receptive field properties of neurons at stage "T"
may be the most easily visible.

The neurons most strongly
affected by the adapting pattern may
be at a different stage in the visual pathways.
Indeed, precisely because the neurons at ``T'' are relatively
insensitive, they may not be susceptible to adaptation.
Instead, the most sensitive neurons,
at the stage labeled ``A'', may adapt very strongly
and become the least sensitive neurons in the pathway.
The spatial properties of pattern adaptation
may be due to the receptive field properties
of the neurons at stage ``A''
and these may be different from
the spatial propreties of the neurons at stage ``T''.
Multiresolution hypotheses or model estimates derived from
pattern adaptation may not generalize
to other behavioral tasks.

To argue that the mechanisms are the same,
we must find experimental measures that link the
spatial properties of the two phenomena.
Only then can we argue confidently that
detection threshold and pattern
adaptation sensitivities are limited by a common set of neurons,
organized using a multiresolution principle.
To test this hypothesis, we might try to
measure the spatial properties of pattern adaptation
experiments and compare these with spatial sensitivity.
Thus, we must study some of the regularities of
the adaptation effects and estimate the spatial
properties of the pattern adaptation mechanisms.

\subsection{Adaptation to Mixtures}

I will be somewhat disappointed if
the reader who has been following this book consistently
cannot guess what type of experiment we will consider next.
If we are to understand pattern adaptation, then
we must understand how we adapt to
arbitrary stimuli, not just sinusoids.
To extend our measurements from sinusoids to general patterns,
we must perform mixture experiments,
experiments in which we measure
adaptation to the sum of two adapting patterns.

For example, suppose that we measure the loss of sensitivity due to
adaptation at frequency $f$.
We then measure the loss of sensitivity due to
adaptation at frequency $3f$.
Finally, we measure the effect of simultaneous adaptation
to the sum of the two adapting patterns.
Can we use the individual measurements to predict the behavioral
performance to the sum?

The filled circles plot the change in sensitivity
following adaptation to a three cpd stimulus.
The open circles plot the change in sensitivity following
adpatation to a nine cpd stimulus.
The triangles show the change in sensitivity following
adaptation to the superposition of the three and nine cpd
stimuli.
Notice that near a test spatial frequency
of nine cpd, the superposition is less effective than
the nine alone.

Nachmias and his colleagues
performed pattern adaptation mixture experiments.
Some of their results are shown in Figure \ref{f6:NachmiasAdaptation}.
Each curve in \ref{f6:NachmiasAdaptation}
represents threshold elevation
for sinusoidal gratings at different spatial frequencies
following adaptation to a single adapting pattern.
Each curve was measured
using a different adapting patterns.

The curve with the filled circles
plots threshold elevation at different
spatial frequencies when the adapting stimulus was a 
three cycles per degree sinusoidal grating.
Confirming Blakemore and Campbell, there is considerable
threshold elevation at 3 cycles per degree and
less adaptation at both higher and lower spatial frequencies.
This is the frequency-specific adaptation phenomenon
that first attracted our interest and motivated the
multiresolution hypothesis.

The curve with the open circles shows the threshold elevations
when the adapting field was a nine cycle per degree grating.
For historical reasons,
the contrast of this grating was one third the contrast
of the grating at the fundamental.
But even at this reduced contrast,
the nine cycle per degree
grating also causes a significant threshold elevation
for nine cycles per degree test stimuli.

The third curve describes threshold elevation
following adaptation
to the mixture of the stimuli
used to obtain the two previous curves.
Blakemore and Campbell had noticed that for
some observers, mixtures of the
$f$ and $3f$ graints
elevates threshold at both three cpd and nine cpd.
For this observer, the mixture of the $f$ and $3f$ gratings
does not elevate threshold for the $3f$ grating.
And for all of the observers in this study
the loss of sensitivity to the mixture
is less than the loss of sensitivity
when the $3f$ stimulus is used alone.
Adapting to the mixture of
$f$ and $3f$ is {\em less} potent 
than adapting to $3f$ alone.

The change of sensitivity when we adapt
with the mixture is difficult to reconcile
with the simple interpretation of adaptation
and spatial frequency channels in Figure \ref{f6:ModelAdaptation}.
If the adaptation to $3f$ stimulates a different set of
neurons from adaptation to $f$, then why should
adapting to $3f$ and $f$ improve sensitivity at $3f$?
The quick response is that the component-images
are not really as independent of one another as we had imagined;
perhaps they are not completely separate neurons with separate
inputs.
But what implications would such a hypothetical
interaction have for other
experiments, such as threshold sensitivity?
And what does it mean when channels interact?
Are they still separate channels, or are the interactions
sufficiently powerful to make the notion of independent
channels meaningless?
Before we can rely on this experimental method to
interpret the visual pathways and other experiments,
we must develop a better theory of the adaptation phenomenon itself.
Perhaps one of you will succeed at this.
