Contrast sensitivity -- Fig. 5, measurable, mild
Color discrimination with high contrast -- Fig. 8, very small effect
Hue discrimination, small steps, -- Fig. 9, mild effect
Saturation discrimination, -- Fig. 19, mild defect
Texture -- Fig. 12, none
Shape -- Fig. 13, small
Size of checkerboards, -- Fig. 14, repeatable, mild.
Motion detection --  Fig. 15 very small (though large with MT)
Motion discrimination -- Fig. 16 very small or none (large with MT)
Flicker -- FIg. 17 no effect of V4 lesion
Stereo -- Fig. 18, no effect.
Motion detection -- Fig. 19, no effect,
Random dot stereograms -- Fig. 20 modest effect;  chrominance,
in the absence of luminance, even with a V4 lesion can be utilized
by the visual system to process stereoscopic depth.
Shape from motion -- Fig. 21 measurable effect


Most pronounced effects (last in the paper)
greater and lesser.
