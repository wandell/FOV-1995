# Foundations of Vision

I plan to host the original version of Foundations of Vision here in the branch original.

I will then start to edit and add material for a second edition in the master branch. 

My intention at this moment is to build the book using [Jupyter books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

I am also planning to start a second book, Foundations of Image Systems Engineering (FISE), in a separate repository.   That book, which I also intend to build with jupyterbook, will focus on the material Joyce Farrell and I teach in Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221).
