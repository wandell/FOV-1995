# Foundations of Vision

I plan to host the original version of Foundations of Vision here in the branch original.

I am starting to edit the current material and add new material for a second edition.  The original material is in the directory 1995, and the new material for an online version will be in 2021. 

At this moment my intention is to build the book using [Jupyter books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).  But I am trying to figure out whether that will be convenient.

## Related book

In separate repositories I am planning to start a book, Foundations of Image Systems Engineering (FISE).   That book will focus on the material Joyce Farrell and I teach in Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221).
