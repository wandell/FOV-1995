# Foundations of Vision

I am starting to edit the current material and add new material for a second edition.  The original book material is in the [Wordpress site FOV-1995](https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu/)

The new material for an online-first version is starting here.

I started out thinking [Jupyter books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).  But I am trying to figure out whether that will be convenient.

I have shifted to Quarto.

In a separate repositories I have started a book, Foundations of Image Systems Engineering (FISE-git). 
That book focuses on the material Joyce Farrell and I teach in Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221).

Each quarter I teach (ISE or MRI) I work on the relevant book.

I have a fantasy of writing Foundations of Neuroimaging.  FONI-2025.  Wish me look.

# Wordpress

See the comments on the FISE-2024-git site for methods in Quarto, pandoc, Zotero, Paperpile, and Wordpress.

I am hoping to use Affinity and Powerpoint and I may need Adobe tools.  

I regret needing all these separate tools.  Truly.  What a life.

And yes, so far it's just me.  Thinking about how helpful Pete Farley and Sinauer was in 1995 ...  this is a new age.
