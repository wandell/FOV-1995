# Foundations of Vision

I plan to host the original version of Foundations of Vision here in the branch original.

I am starting to edit the current material and add new material for a second edition in the V2 branch. 

My intention at this moment is to build the book using [Jupyter books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

In separate repositories I am planning to start a book, Foundations of Image Systems Engineering (FISE).   That book, which I also intend to build with jupyterbook, will focus on the material Joyce Farrell and I teach in Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221).
