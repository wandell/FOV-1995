I finally got around to checking out the Berlin & Kay (1969) naming study.
As you recall, in addition to finding eleven basic categories, they found
that the opponent colors appear "first". That is, all languages had white
and black, any language with 3 or more basic names had red, any with 5 or
more had green and yellow, any with 6 or more had blue. Brown, orange,
purple, pink, and grey come later. I seem to remember that you don't
emphasize the priority of the opponent color names in your chapter, instead
referring mainly to the 11 categories. Is there  reason for this that I
want to know about? Do you not think it important?
