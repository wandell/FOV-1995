* Jack -
* Probably the best entre to the literature related to the
* subtaction method (as well as a good discussion of the main
* issues) can be had in Duncan Luce's book "Response Times:
* Their role in inferring elementary metnal organization.
* (Oxford 1986).  Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 are the places to
* look.  Duncan references various papers, including the 1969
* translation of Donders, Taylor's application of an
* additivity test, and a couple of my papers.  Duncan also
* mentions one of Cattell's papers; others may also be
* interesting, and can be found in Poffenberger(ed) James
* McKeen Cattell: Man of Science. (The Science Press, 1947).
* 
* A couple of papers by R. Gottsdanker cannot be easily traced from
* the above, and may be worth a look:
* 
* Gottsdanker, R. & Tietz, J. D.  An ""exhaustive'' search
* for tasks that fall between the choice and simple
* reactions.  Journal of Motor Behavior. 1992, 24, 147-156.
* 
* Gottsdanker, R. & Shragg, G. P.  Verification of Donders'
* subtraction method.  Journal of Experimental Psychology:
* Human Perception & Performance. 1985, 11, 765-776.
* 
* And another relevant paper that is hard to trace,
* specifically on simple versus choice RT, is Frith, C.D. &
* Done, D. J. (1986) Routes to action in reaction time
* tasks.  Psychological Research, 48, 169-177.
* 
* Some interesting antiquities can be found in J. Jastrow,
* The time-relations of mental phenomena (1890)
* 
* Of course, any time search processes are studied using
* RT, the subtraction method is being employed. I have
* argued that this is a domain where it is more likely
* to be valid, and where there is a test of its validity -
* that resides in the linearity of the growth of mean RT
* with size of the search set.  Most people don't discuss
* the subtraction method in this context.
* 
* I hope these suggestions are of some help.
