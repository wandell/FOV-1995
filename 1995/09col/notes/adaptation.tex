As the illumination varies,
the visual system undergoes profound changes.
The study of these visual {\em adaptations},
has been a central component
of experimental color vision for a hundred years.

In the main, visual adaptation has been studied using
threshold measurements.
But, these threshold measurements
have counterparts in terms of appearance.
For example, when we walk into a darkened movie theatre,
at first we see little and have a great deal of trouble
finding our seats.
After severald minutes, the visual pathways
adjust to the reduced illumination level and we can
easily see the area around us.
When we leave the darkened theatre and emerge into the light, 
we must adjust again.
This time, the adjustment is much shorter.
These two types of adaptation are distinguished
as {\em light} and {\em dark adaptation}, even though
they both represent the visual pathway's adjustment to a new
mean illumination.

Measurements of sensitivity changes during
dark adaptation were among the most important demonstrations
of the existence of distinct rod and cone pathways.
Figure~\ref{f8:rodcone} show two classic sets of
threshold measurements that illustrate the change
between rod and cone vision.
The panel on the left of the figure shows a set of dark
adaptation curves measured by Hecht et al.
Observers were exposed to a bright uniform field, which
was extinguished.
Then,  for the next half hour, they continued to set thresholds
to a violet test spot seen XXX deg in the periphery.

There are a number of observations that
confirm that the two branches of the dark adaptation
curves can be attributed to
detection mediated by the cones and the rods.
1.  Colored appearance.
2.  Depends on where the test is presented.
3.  Depends on the color of the test.
