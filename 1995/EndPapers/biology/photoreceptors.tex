\subsection*{Photoreceptors}

\be

\item Three basic categories of human cone photopigments;
one category of human rod photopigment
% Wandell,  J. Ross

%\item Number of cone types:  3
%\item 3 or 4 = number of cone types.
%\item Number of rod types:  1

\item Foveal cone size: 5-6 $\mu$ wide;, 80 $\mu$ width
% Wandell, Wooding
%\item Dimensions of cone: 5-8 microns long by 5 microns diam

\item Extrafoveal cone size: 7-10 $\mu$ diameter; 40 $\mu$ length
% Wooding, Tyler

\item Typical rod size: 1 $\mu$ diameter, 30 $\mu$ long.
%\item Diameter of smallest cone or rod is 1 u, packed at up to 300 per deg.
% Wooding

\item There are $10^8$ photopigment molecules per rod. Each one can be
photoisomerized in 100 femtosec.  They are packed into 800 disks
% Tyler

\item Energy amplification provided by rod: 10e4 - 10e5
%Tyler

\item Percent of all receptors in body which are in the retinae: 70\%
