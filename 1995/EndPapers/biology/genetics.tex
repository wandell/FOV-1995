\be

\item The genes encoding rhodopsin and cyanopsis have five exons, those
encoding chlorolabe and erythrolabe have six.

\item The opsin proteins of rhodopsin and cyanolabe consist of 348 amino
acids, those of chlorolabe and erythrolabe consist of 364.

\item The gene that encodes rhodopsin is on chromosome 3 (3q21- 3qter), the
cyanolabe gene is on chromosome 7 (7q22-7qter), and the genes for
chlorolabe and erythrolabe are on the X chromosome (Xq28).
