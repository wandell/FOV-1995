\subsection*{Retina}

\be

\item Retinal thickness: $400 \mu$
%\item Thickness of retina: 350 microns
% Wooding, Wandell

\item Total retinal area XXX $mm ^ 2$.
% Get this fact

\item One deg is about .3 mm (300 u) on the retina.
%\item One deg of visual angle = 0.0002967 m on the retina = .2967mm.
%\item 0.3 mm on the retina = 1 degree of visual angle
% Boynton, Tyler, Wandell

\item Size of fovea 0.8 mm 
%my guess ($120 cones \times 6 \mu$) 
% Wandell

\item Optic nerve head is $5$ deg wide and $7$ deg vertical
% Adams

\item The rod-free, capillary-free foveola is 0.5 deg in diameter.
% Boynton

\item 2-3 ganglion cells per foveal cone
\comment{  (Schein, 1988;  Wassle et al. 1989a, cited in Kolb, 1991)}
% Schein

\item 1.5 * $10^6$ optic nerve fibers/retina 
%\item $10^6$ fibers in each optic nerve.  
\comment{(Sherman and Koch, p. 249)}
% Wandell

\item Number of fibers/optic nerve $10^6$

\item Ratio of receptors to fibers = 125:1
%John Ross

\item There are about  3500 cones in the central (foveolar) half degree.  
The same number as in a 5 deg diameter patch at 40 deg eccentricity.
% Tyler said 4000, I adjusted 'cause 60 x 60 is 3600 and this is a
% circle, not a square
% Tyler, Wandell

\item [Cat] $10^5$ optic nerve fibers per retina
