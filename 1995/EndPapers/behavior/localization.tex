\subsection*{Localization resolution}

 \be

  \item Typical localization threshold: 6 arc sec, which is 0.2 the width of
a cone photorceptor inner segment; equivalent to seeing an eye
movement at a distance of one mile; world's record for vernier acuity
is 0.8 arc sec in Dennis Levi's right eye
% Cavanagh, Klein, Tyler, Wandell, many

\item The best hyperacuity is equivalent to a retinal distance of one
tenth of the  wavelength of red light
%Tyler

\item One can localize a peripheral point to within one tenth of a
hypercolumn.
