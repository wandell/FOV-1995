\item  Use a diagram to explain why the retinal image does not change
size when the pupil changes size

\item  Suppose a lens has a focal length of 100mm meter.
Where will the image plane of a line one meter from the
center of the lens be?
Suppose the line is 5 mm high.
Using a picture, show how large the size of the image
will be.
\comment{Lensmaker's equation:
1/F = 1/d0 + 1/d1
where F = focal length, d0 = distance to source, d1 = distance to image
1/100 = 1/1000 + 1/x
