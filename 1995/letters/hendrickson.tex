Dear Professor Hendrickson:

Although we have never met, I have admired your work for many years.

I am writing to ask you for a favor.
I am preparing a book on vision that will be published
in November 1994.
I would like to include some of your retinal
anatomy images, particularly a retinal cross-section,
to identify the layers and cell types.
I would like an image that includes the fovea and
perhaps a second image, like the classic Boycott and Dowling
image, that shows a peripheral cross-section with the layers
more equal in size.
An example of a foveal picture
is the one in your paper with Yuodelis in 1984, reproduced
by Rodieck in his review paper.

Can send me a picture or two that I can use?

If you think the cross-section in the paper with Yuodelis is the
best, then I will simply ask the publisher for permission to use
that and request it from you by a separate permission letter.
On the other hand, some of my colleagues have pictures sitting
in drawers that they prefer to the published work;
whenever possible, I try to get those.
Perhaps you have a favorite retinal anatomy picture,
either published or unpublished, that you think I should use.

Thank you very much for any help you can give.

\myclosing{Sincerely}
