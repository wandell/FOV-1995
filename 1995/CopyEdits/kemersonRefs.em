Hi Brian, 

I think this is the end of it.

Before you read the list, let me drop the bomb. Anyway I can get the info 
that I need to complete the references by Monday or is that impossible, 
given your schedule? I need to fill in the blanks, clean up the file, and 
code it to send to typesetter. He wants to have time to work on it before he 
gets the index. The index will be arriving here Wed. a.m. and I think I have 
to have that corrected and coded in one day (ha) to send to typesetter Wed 
nite (HA). I am going to request that indexer send you a hard copy of the 
index so you can make changes if necessary.

Hi Brian,

Thanks for your speedy replies. A few more questions in that area, then I'm 
coding it for Paul and letting go.

Gibson, '62 ref. Your title reads, "Visual mechanisms in a 
cone-monochromat." Is that the complete title, and NOTE: can I have the vol. 
and pages, too???

Rushton, 1962 No problem changing ref to the reprint you used, but I need 
the pub date of the edited text.


Polyak ref. I dropped the long title, but will need the title of Kluver's 
book, and the pages, if possible.

The Mollon et al., 1980 ref (page 2 of my fax) Can you provide pages? Also, 
want to confirm that title is correct. There is a Moreland 82 ref that cites 
Verriest as editor of "Colour Deficiencies" Two different books????

Please provide correct spelling for Parkinnen. One "k" and two "n's"??


Too bad about the Gouras and Evers ref. It is cited once in text. Just kill 
the ref? Not sure if I can kill it in text at this point without creating a 
major problem. Have not received pages yet.


Will enter change to figure 4.11. I assume there is room for add'l text.


Cheers,

K

Hi Brian,

Don't faint, this isn't so bad. Unfortunately, I don't have pages to work 
from, only galleys, so I can't provide a page number for you. Sorry.

Here is the Ch. 2 info:

Campbell and Gubisch, 1967. I have 1966 in my refs.

Williams et al., 1995. I have 1994 in refs.

Westheimer, 1984. (Fig. 2.15) Not in refs.

Helmholtz, 1909 (Footnote 7) That year not in refs.

Yellott et al., 1981. I have only Yellott et al., 1984.

Yellott et al., 1980 (Exercise #3) Not in refs.



Ch. 3 info:


Campbell and Gubisch, '67. I have 66

Schwartz, 1978. I have 1967

Baylor et al., 1987. I have a Baylor et al. in refs waiting for a date.

Stockman and Macleod, '93 (Fig. 3.3) I have Stockman et al., 1993.

DeMonasterio et al., 1981. I have only 1985.

LeGrand, 1935. I have 1937 in my refs.

Williams, 1985. Should be "a" or "b"

Bowmaker and Mollon, '93. I have Mollon and Bowmaker, '92 in refs.


Chapter 4

Newton, Opticks. Not in refs. No date in galleys, either.


James Clerk Maxwell, (Exercise #9) not in refs.


And that is it for Chs.1 - 4. Not bad at all.


I think that leaves me with 8, 10, and 11, which I will do post-haste, 
because I have to finish the refs by Tuesday at the very latest....


The end is in sight, the end is in sight, the end......zzzz


K
