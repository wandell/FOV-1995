{\em A rod-initiated pathway}
in the vertebrate retina.
Axons from more than 1000 rods converge upon
a single rod bipolar cell.
The rod bipolar send their outputs to a specialized
amacrine cell, the AII, located in the inner plexiform layer.
The AII amacrine cell communicates the rod-initiated signal
to two types of ganglion cells, one whose dendritic field is in the
upper layers of the inner plexiform layer and another whose dendritic
field is in the lower layers.
The responses of ganglion cells whose dendritic fields are 
in the upper layer are decreased by light, while responses of
ganglion cells whose dendritic fields are in the lower layer
are increased by light (Source: Boycott and W\"assle, 1991).
