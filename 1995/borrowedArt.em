Hi Brian,

I returned the prints, slides, etc. for your book today (UPS). I have one 
favor to ask of you. I enclosed everything in a large envelope, and wrote 
the Figure # and source on the outside of the envelope. I meant to copy that 
list so I would have a record of what I returned to you, but I didn't 
remember this until I had the package wrapped and ready to ship. Could you 
make a copy for me and send it on? No hurry, at your convenience. I'm sorry 
that the list is not in chronological order--I simply wrote things down as I 
cleared them. 

I returned some of the art directly to the authors/artists. Here is a list 
of those people and the Fig. # from your text:

	3.4 Christine Curcio
	3.7 Peter Lennie (Per Peter Farley, I sent him Dr. Schein's slides)
	5.6 Toni Haun
	6.2 Jennifer Lund
	6.4 Michele Anderson (for Dr. Stryker; we replaced the broken mount)
	6.11 Darlene Campbell (for Gary Blasdel)
	8.2 Daniel Kersten (wrapped this one up extra carefully)
	11.9 Peter Thompson
	
I enclosed a brief thank you letter to each of these folks. With the 
exception of the slide for Fig 11.4 (Chris wants to hold that for a while), 
I believe everything is en route to its rightful owners. 

I am 95% done reviewing the permissions file, and they look very clean. I am 
processing permissions payments this week, and as soon as I finish matching 
permissions letters with text figures, I'll send you a list of what I think 
is still outstanding.

We have a 3-day weekend coming up, and I have to say that I am looking 
forward to it, although my "free" time is quickly evaporating.

Take care,

K
