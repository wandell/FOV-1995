Here's the copy from long ago from the catalog. Would you like to edit it 
for the brochure? Some things have changed since this was written, I think.

Foundations of Vision Science:

Behavior, Neuroscience, and Computation

Brian A. Wandell, Stanford University



Vision science draws on a wide range of intellectual traditions,
including neuroscience, psychophysics, and computational
modeling. This textbook is the first to bring together the broad
array of data and theory accumulated in the field for students,
scientists, and engineers interested in learning the core ideas
of vision science. 

	The first section of Foundations of Vision Science consists of
an introduction and three chapters that describe image encoding.
These chapters review optical image formation by the cornea and
lens, retinal sampling, and wavelength-encoding by the
photoreceptors. The second section consists of four
chapters on image representation.  **These chapters cover the
retina, visual cortex, pattern sensitivity, and multiresolution
representations of images.** The third section of the book
reviews how images are interpreted. This
section consists of two chapters, on computational and
experimental studies of color appearance, motion and depth.
The third chapter in this section contains
demonstrations and ***discussion of how we see objects**. Topics such as
color appearance, cortical colorblindness, motion flow, motion
appearance, motion physiology, and visual illusions are also
included in this part of the book.

	Foundations of Vision Science is suitable for upper-level
undergraduate or graduate courses on vision science in
psychology, neuroscience, engineering, or computer science
departments. Foundations of Vision Science contains special
study exercises at the ends of most chapters that enrich the
main material and point the way to additional information in the
literature. Finally, the book has **FIVE** appendixes: an
introduction to linear systems methods; a discussion of monitor
calibration; an introduction to Bayesian classifiers; **a review of
basic linear algebra methods**; and a discussion of optic flow computation.
