Dear Jim:

This letter is to indicate that I hold the copyright to the text
material you are planning to use for your class.  Based on our
discussions, I am pleased to grant you permission to use the text in
your course this fall at the University of Minnesota.

And I am sure you will ask your students not to distribute this
version since it is in a draft state and continues to be revised.

Thank you for agreeing to use the text and to help me out with your
comments.  Good luck with your class.  I hope you enjoy using the
notes.

\myclosing{Sincerely}
