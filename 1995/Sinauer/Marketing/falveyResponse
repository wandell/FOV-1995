Dear Kerry,

Here is a start on the answers to your questionnaire.  I am interested
in the marketing of my book, of course, and I think that it may be
a little unusual compared to other books you are used to handling.
So, I look forward to having a discussion with you about the book
and to thinking about some things we might do to get the book sold.

Professor Brian Wandell was born in New York, Oct. 6 1951.  He
received his B.Sc. in Mathematics and Psychology from the University
of Michigan, and he received his Ph.D. studying with R. Duncan Luce at
UC Irvine, Columbia, and Harvard.  Wandell has been a member of the
Psychology and Neuroscience Departments at Stanford University since
1979.  His research includes models of color appearance, surface and
illuminant estimation, industrial applications of color science, and
functional magnetic resonance imaging of neural activity.  Wandell is
a Fellow the Optical Society of America.  He has served as an editor
of {\em Vision Research} and {\em Neural Nets}, a consultant to
Hewlett-Packard and Xerox Corporation, and he is the principal
organizer of the {\em Smart Color} seminar series on industrial
color imaging.  Wandell won the 1986 Troland Research Award from the
U.S.  National Academy of Sciences for his work in color vision.

II. Book Information

	A.	Please give us a brief description of your book for use in 
our catalog.  In approximately 50-75 words, please include information on 
the general purpose of your book, its organization, special emphasis, 
central theme or themes, and distinguishing features.  



*************
Insert: brief
********

This volume brings together the broad array of data and theory
accumulated in Vision Science.  The book is divided into three
sections plus an appendix.  The first part of the book explains how
images are encoded within the eye.  The second part explains how the
initial encoding is transformed into a neural representation within
the brain, and how this neural reperesentation can be elucidated by
behavioral studies.  The third part of the book reviews the
computations necessary to interpret images.  Here, topics such as
color appearance, motion appearance, and visual illusions pertaining
to object recognition are reviewed.


	B.	Please give us an expanded general description of the book 
for general promotional purposes.  In approximately 250 words, please 
explain your book's general purpose, audience, chapter sequence or general 
organization and content, central theme or themes, and distinguishing 
features.

                 Foundations of Vision Science
             Behavior, Neuroscience and Computation
			Brian A. Wandell
		       Stanford University

This volume is the first textbook to bring together the broad array of
data and theory accumulated in Vision Science.  It is designed for
students, scientists and engineers interested in learning about the
basic theory and data of Vision Science.  

The book consists of three sections and an appendix.  The first
section of the book consists of an introduction and three chapters
that describe image encoding.  These chapters review optical image
formation by the cornea and lens retinal sampling and
wavelength-encoding by the photoreceptors.  The optical quality of the
eye is reviewed as are the basic structures of the eye and the
mechanisms of encoding the spatial and wavelength properties of the
image.

The book's second section consists of four chapters on image
representation.  The section begins by reviewing the representation of
visual information processing within the retina and visual cortex.
The multiple parallel visual neural pathways originating in the
retina, and the distribution and processing of these pathways within
the visual cortex are described.  Next, related studies of the human
abilty to detect and discriminate spatial, temporal and colored
patterns are reviewed.  Here, the reader is introduced to the
behavioral methods of analyzing these neural pathways.  The
experimental and logical basis of multiresolution image
representations used in engineering and image processing, such as
image pyramids and wavelets, are introduced and discussed.

The third section of the book reviews how to interpret images in terms
of objects.  This section consists of two chapters that review
computational and experimental studies of color appearance, and then
motion and depth. These chapters are followed by a chapter with many
demonstrations concerning concerning object perception.  Topics such
as color appearance, cortical colorblindness, motion flow, motion
appearance, motion physiology, and a visual illusions are included in
this part of the book.

The book also contains special study exercises at the end of most
chapters.  The questions enrich the main material and point the way to
additional material in the literature.  Finally, the book has an
appendix consisting of four parts: (a) an introduction to linear
systems methods, (b) a discussion of monitor calibration, (c) an
introduction to Bayesian classifiers, and (d) a discussion of optic
flow computation.

in the book, such as references, annotated bibliographies, chapter 
summaries, etc.
