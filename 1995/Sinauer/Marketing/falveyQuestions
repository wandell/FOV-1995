Dear Dr. Wandell:

We are beginning to assemble the information we will need to prepare our 
announcement brochure for Foundations of Vision Science. Toward that end, I 
need you to complete the following Biographical and Marketing Questionnaire. 
Please return the completed questionnaire, by June 15 if at all possible, to 
my attention at Sinauer Associates.

On another note, Pete Farley and I have been discussing ways to tap into the 
electrical and computer engineering types who may be interested in 
purchasing single copies of the book. From a commercial mail list supplier 
that we use quite regularly, I can get about 4500 labels under rubrics like 
Pattern Recognition (4100), Computer Vision (400), and Image Processing 
(25). Can you give me leads to help me identify any national organizations 
of ECE types, who might have a division or two that would be appropriate 
targets for the brochure mailing. And, if you have other suggestions for 
groups we should target, I would welcome your imput.

You can respond to all of this by email to: scudder@sinauer.com.

Thanks for your help.
