That's a question I have wondered about for years.  I have never answered it
empirically nor do I know anyone who has addressed it.  I think it might 
effect chromatic aberration but I haven't done a ray trace. 
An artificial pupil placed in front of the cornea definitely produces 
vignetting in the peripheral visual field though the effect axially is 
probably small.  I always use optics to image the artificial pupil in the 
plane of the natural pupil just to be on the safe side, even when viewing 
CRTs.   This solution has the additional feature that one has continuous 
control over refractive state and beats fussing with trial lenses for 
spherical correction. 
This is particularly nice when you don't require astigmatic correction, as
with one-dimensional stimuli.
You place two lenses between the observer and the CRT, with the first lens
one focal length from the eye and the second lens one focal length from an
artificial pupil that lies between the CRT and the lens. 
This ensures that the artificial pupil will be conjugate with the natural
pupil.  Moving the observer's head and the first lens together relative to
the second lens changes the focus without changing the magnification of the
CRT image.   The loss in image quality attributable to adding two lenses
is negligible if you buy reasonable quality optics.
