I've looked over your pyramid chapter, and can give you some comments.
I'm not sure how to do this, since the best approach would be to sit
down with you and explain my scribbled notes in the margin.

I am enthusiastic about the approach you are taking in the book.  I
think it is great to see just how far you can go with a few simple
concepts applied thoughtfully but relentlessly.  At the same time I
wonder if you are too thoroughgoing in relying on matrix notation (and
matrix tableaus) for everything.  I think that numerical examples and
pictures would often help the intuitions.  In the pyramid chapter, I
think it would be valuable to see the construction of a 1-D pyramid,
using a pyramid tree.  It is also helpful to see examples, in both 1-D
and 2-D, of signals that have been filtered, subsampled, and
interpolated to various levels.  I am able to follow your matrix
version of things (and it is cute to see it cast into that format),
but only because I am able to map it into other pictures that are
already familiar to me.  A student will need some help with that mapping.

Your story about image data compression and its link to vision is one
that I would like to believe -- indeed it was this sort of thought
that led us to work with the Laplacian pyramid in the first place.
But DCT's work quite well for data compression, whereas Beau's cortex
transform works rather poorly, even though Beau's system would seem
more visually appropriate.  Data compression is a highly non-linear
process, and no one fully understands what makes for a good system.

One other general comment.  I can see that you are struggling with a
difficult problem throughout the book: how can you use concepts from
linear algebra, linear systems, DSP, information theory, etc., without
stopping and devoting a chapter to each of those topics by itself?  So
you slip them in as part of the ongoing narrative.  This is a great
idea but it has its difficulties.  It means that you are often using
terms that have not been defined (not at all Wandel-like!).  I think
you really need to pause in the image coding chapter and talk about
information theory, in isolation.  Likewise, I think you have to give
a lecture on sampling, aliasing, and interpolation at some point in
the book.  In the edge-detection chapter, you discuss the problem of
approximating derivatives in sampled systems in a couple of sentences
in the Roberts discussion. This topic -- the relationship between
continuous and discrete signals and signal processing -- needs a full
discussion.  Students should know, for example, that if a signal is
bandlimited then in principle all continuous operations can be defined
exactly in discretely sampled systems.

Anyway, I have lots of other comments, if only we can figure out how
to communicate.  By the way, I will be in San Jose for SPIE in early
February, so that might be a good time if you wanted to do something
in person.  Otherwise, we could do it on the phone -- while each of us
looks at a copy of the draft.

Hi,

Thanks for your comments.  I am really grateful that you looked
at the book.  I know how time-consuming that kind of thing can be.

Can we proceed by (a) you send me your scribbled notes, which
I will try to decipher, (b)  I call you up for some general
questions about them, and (c) when you come out to SPIE I
will buy you lunch/dinner or whatever and we can chat some more.

Your comments are particularly helpful to me just now because
I think I have reached a similar conclusion about needing to find a
place in the book to stop and talk a little bit about tools, and
reduce the chitchat.  

Right now my plan is to ditch all the edge-detection
stuff, which seems dated and requires a lot of work anyway.
I will replace that material
with some tools.  I will probably keep the discriminants,
add Kalman filtering, 
and extend the linear algebra to discuss
the sampling and reconstruction issues (which I don't think of as
particularly in the Fourier Transform domain, but just as squaring up
matrix sizes, or inverting matrices) and the svd.
Your comments are keeping me going in that direction and also
are useful as specific suggestions about which things to incorporate.

Of course, neat examples of any of these things are always
useful.  So, send along your favorite.

Again, thanks a lot.  Send along a copy of any scribbled
notes you have.  Then I will call to set up a time
for a phone conversation.

brian

P.S.  By the way, I heard Kanade on some of their motion work yesterday.
I thought it was really neat.

I look forward to the new chapter -- I would like to see a clear,
simple discussion of Kalman, SVD, etc., since they seem to be very
important and very simple, but I only have a rough understanding of
them. (They are always discussed in the middle of a hairy textbook).

If I understand your comment, I agree that sampling and reconstruction
issues are usefully conceptualized in terms of matrix inversion, but
the Fourier basis set has the special property of translational
invariance, which other bases lack.  This is necessary if we are to
say that a signal can be sampled and reconstructed "transparently,"
without regard for the alignment of the sampling lattice and the signal.

My scribbled notes are in the margins of the book.  Do you want me to
send the whole thing?

--Ted



Send whatever is easiest for you.  If you want to keep the book
and send a copy of the marked-up pages, that is fine.
If you want to send the whole thing that is fine.
Or, send back what you have and I can 
return you a fresh copy later.

You know, I don't think I have paid enough attention to
the issue of shift-invariance in the representation.  In
part that is because the human representation is so
plainly shift-variant, that I didn't think it worth a lot
of effort.  I probably would have said we use eye movements
as a substitute for shift-invariance, at least that's what
I say in class at present.

But, for machines or conceptual representations, shift-invariance
is quite helpful.  I do spend quite a bit of time on it
in the first chapter (optics and photoreceptor sampling) where
I also discuss sinusoids and shift-invariance a lot.  But,
perhaps I should bring it up again later on.
 
Again, thanks a lot for your time, and I am looking forward to
taking up even more of it in conversation.

brian
