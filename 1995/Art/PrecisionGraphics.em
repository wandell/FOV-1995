Glad to hear that worked. Guess we oughta thank whoever wrote that filter. 
You can send the files to:

Jan Flessner
Precision Graphics
106 South Neil St.
Champaign, IL 61820

You can use our FedEx number (which you should have).

Also, I'm about to send the first batch of art.

And I have a copy of the cut-and-pasted version of the intro to Chapter 2.

I'd prefer to discuss these last two items by phone, but haven't been able 
to reach you. If you get a chance, could you give me a call today?

Pete
