In the section of visual streams, remember to
add in Kolb's description of the rod pathway.
Describe the basic pathway:

rod to rod-bipolar to AII amacrine which connects
in the innere and outer plexiform layers to
cone ganglion cells (on one and one off).

Make the point that
(a) this is a good example of a local pathway (involves
rod-bipolar synapse, bipolar amacrine synapse, amacrine ganglion
cell synapse) and then this local and independent pathway
merges with another existing pathway.
This is a kind of multiplexing since under high illumination
levels the cone signals come from the
retinal ganglion cells, while under low illuminationconditions
the rod signals come from this same source.

Why is this useful and why is this possible?  Well, for one thing
the computational machinery that is used to
estimate shape, motion, and so forth that usually works
with respect to the cones is also available to analyze the
rod signal.
There is no need for duplication of these.
Furthermore, there is no additional specialized circuitry necessary.

Why is the pathway separate even as far as the ganglion cells?
Pooling requirements are different.  Size and location of the
rods are different.
Also, there seems to be a major proliferation of information
within the retina, as evidenced by the large number of bipolar
cell types (18/cone synapse!) yet there maybe
a need for an efficient representation out the optic tract to
permit good eye mobility.

See if there is a published Wassle confirmation.   Take the image
from Kolb's papers.

Numbers game:

Suppose we have an area of 100 x 100 cones.
Suppose that there is one midget for each cone -> 10,000 midget.
Suppose that we sample this area at 1/3 resolution for
red/green color.  Then there will be 1000 red green cells.
Suppose that we sample at 1/9 resolution for blue/yellow.
Then there will be 500 blue/yellow cells.
Hence, of the 11500 cells, 87 percent are light-dark cells,
9 percent are red/green, and 4 percent are blue/yellow.
