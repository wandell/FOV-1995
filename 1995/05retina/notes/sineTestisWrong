.lh "The relationship between spatial phase and temporal amplitude"
.pp
Earlier in this chapter
we reviewed some special cases in which measurements
of the response of retinal ganglion cells revealed a regular
relationship between the spatial phase of a contrast-reversal grating
and the amplitude of the temporal response.
We saw that in these measurements (e.g. figure \n(g7 ), the
amplitude of the output varies sinusoidally
with the spatial phase of the grating.
Hochstein and Shapley (1976) suggested that we use these
measurements to test for the spatial linearity of X-cells.
Some authors use this
graph as a replacement for Enroth-Cugell and Robson's null test.
.pp
But in general,
the relationship between the amplitude of the temporal
response and the spatial phase of the contrast-reversal
grating need not be a sinusoidal function of spatial phase.
This was recognized in 1978 by Movshon, Tolhurst and Thompson
who showed that not only
does the relationship not have to follow a sinusoidal function,
but that a cell can be linear and still not
have any null points!
Their results are important because, although ganglion
cells and lateral geniculate cells appear to have the
special properties required that make the null test appropriate,
cortical neurons don't have the special properties.
.pp
In this appendix we will derive the predicted relationship
for a general linear neuron and the output discharge.
From this derivation, we will be able to see
what special properties a neuron must have
if the amplitude of its temporal
response is a sinsusoidal function of spatial phase.
.pp
Suppose a receptive field is linear with spatio-temporal
impulse response $RF[ mu , t ]$ ($mu$ refers to space and $t$ to time).
Suppose that our contrast-reversing grating, $cos (t) cos ( mu )$
will be presented at different spatial phase positions, $phase$.
Thus, we will present the neuron with a series of stimuli,
$cos (t) cos ( mu - phase ) $, 
which is simply the contrast-reversing grating at different
phase positions.
If the neuron is linear, then
the output as a function of the spatial position
of the input and time is
.NE
.EQ
o( phase , t ) = sumtau summu RFmt cos ( mu - phase ) cos ( t - tau )
.EN
We can analyze the output in terms of sinusoidal and cosinusoidal
functions of spatial phase and time using the same trigonometric
identities we used earlier.
First, move the $cos ( t - tau )$ term outside the summation
with respect to $mu$.
.NE
.EQ
o( phase , t ) = sumtau cos ( t - tau ) summu RFmt cos ( mu - phase )~~~.
.EN
Now substitute for the $cos ( mu - phase )$ term using the trigonometric identity
.NE c0
.EQ
cos ( mu - phase ) = cos ( mu ) cos ( phase ) + sin ( mu ) sin ( phase )
.EN
.ne 2.0i
to find that

.EQ
o( phase , t ) =
{ sumtau cos ( t - tau ) }
 left [
   summu RFmt cos ( phase ) cos ( mu ) + summu RFmt sin ( phase ) sin ( mu )
 right ]
.EN

If we pursue this course relentlessly, decomposing
$cos ( t - tau )$ and re-grouping terms,
we find that the output function is

.EQ
o ( phase , t ) = k11 cos ( phase ) cos ( t ) + k21 cos ( phase ) sin ( t ) 
+ k12 sin ( phase ) cos ( t ) + k22 sin ( phase ) sin ( t )
.EN

where the constants $k sub {ii}$ are defined as
.in 1.0i

$k11 =   sumtau summu cos ( tau ) cos ( mu ) RFmt $

$k21 =   sumtau summu sin ( tau ) cos ( mu ) RFmt $

$k12 =   sumtau summu cos ( tau ) sin ( mu ) RFmt $

$k22 =   sumtau summu sin ( tau ) sin ( mu ) RFmt $.

.ei
.pp
We can group the terms in this formula in several
ways to illustrate some of the properties of the output.
First, consider the output as a function of 
the spatial phase of the input stimulus.
We  group the terms as follows.

.NE ft
.EQ
o ( phase , t  ) 
  = mark ( k11 cos ( t ) + k21 sin ( t  ) ) cos ( phase )
.EN
.IE
.EQ
  + lineup ( k12 cos ( t ) + k22 sin ( t  ) ) sin ( phase )
.EN

The output has the general form $f(t) cos ( phase ) + g(t) sin ( phase )$.
Thus, at any fixed moment in time, 
the output is a cosinusoidal function of the spatial phase.
The amplitude and phase of the cosinusoidal function depend upon
the moment in time at which we measure.
.pp
Alternatively, suppose we consider the output as a function of time.
Then we can group the terms as a weighted sum of a cosinusoid 
and sinusoid of time.
.NE fp
.EQ
o ( phase , t ) mark = ( k11 cos ( phase  ) + k12 sin ( phase  ) ) cos ( t ) 
.EN
.IE
.EQ
lineup + ( k21 cos ( phase  ) + k22 sin ( phase  ) ) sin ( t )
.EN
.br
When grouped this way the output has the general form
$f ( phase ) cos (t) + g ( phase ) sin (t)$.
Thus, at a fixed spatial phase position,
the output function is a cosinusoidal function of time.
Again, the amplitude and temporal phase of the response
depend upon the spatial phase of the input.
.pp
We can compute the dependence of
the amplitude of the temporal response
on the spatial phase of the input stimulus by using the
relationship $amp sup {2}  = f sup {2} ( phase ) + g sup {2} ( phase )$.
.ne 2.0i

   = ( k11 cos ( phase ) + k12 sin ( phase ) ) sup {2}

or expanding and regrouping terms

.EQ

.in 0.5i
$A = k11 sup {2} + k21 sup {2}$,

$B = 2 ( k11 k12  + k21 k22 ) $, and

$C = k12 sup {2} + k22 sup {2}$.
.ei

Finally, using the trigonometric identities

.in 0.5i
$cos sup {2} ( x ) = {  1 + cos ( 2 x ) } / 2 $,

$sin sup {2} ( x ) = { 1 - cos ( 2 x ) } / 2 $,

$cos (x) sin (x) =   { sin ( 2 x ) } / 2 $
.ei

we can substitute
.NE hs
.EQ
amp sup {2} ( phase )
   mark = A ( { 1 + cos ( 2 phase ) } / 2 )
   + B / 2 sin ( 2 phase )
   + C ( { 1 - cos ( 2 phase ) } / 2 )
.EN
.IE
.EQ
lineup = { { A + C } / 2 }
           + left [ 
             { { A - C } / 2 } cos ( 2 phase ) + { B / 2 } sin ( 2 phase ) 
             right ]
.EN
.pp
We find that
the \fBsquared amplitude\fP is a constant $ { A + C } / 2 $,
plus a sinusoidal function of phase.
But notice that
the frequency of the squared amplitude variation's
dependence on the spatial phase
is at twice the spatial frequency of the stimulus.
.pp
We see now why the null test for linearity can fail for linear units.
Because of the constant term, a linear neuron may have no null
positions.
Indeed, Movshon et al. reported on the existence of
such neurons in the visual cortex of the monkey.
Thus, we find that
the null test proposed by Enroth-Cugell
and Robson may fail, and yet the unit may be linear.
Why, then, has the test been
succesful when applied to retinal ganglion cells?

.lh "A special case:  constant temporal phase"
.pp
There are some important special cases in which the
amplitude of the response, rather than the squared amplitude,
has a simple relationship to the spatial phase of the input.
The simple relationship between temporal amplitude and spatial phase
occurs in the following case.
Suppose we measure the temporal response to the flickering
sinusoid at different spatial phase positions.
For each spatial phase position we measure both an
amplitude and a phase of the neuron's output.
In principle, for each spatial phase measurement we might
find a shift in the temporal phase of the neuron's cosinusoidal
output response.
If it turns out in the measurements
that there is no temporal phase shift 
as we measure at different spatial phase positions,
then the amplitude will vary as a cosinusoidal function of spatial phase.
.pp
One way to see why this result will occur is to recall
a result we have already obtained.
We know from equation \n(ft  that if we measure
the response of the neuron at a fixed moment in time,
then the output will be a sinusoidal function of spatial phase.
If there is no temporal phase shift among the measurements we
make, then the measurements at a single moment in time
will be equal to the amplitude of the sinusoid.
In the general case, when the phase of the temporal output
may vary as we measure at different spatial phase positions,
there is no moment in time at which the peak amplitude will
always occur.
.pp
We can prove the simple relationship between temporal amplitude
and spatial phase by considering the
special conditions in which the phase of the temporal output
is constant.
By examining equation \n(fp we find that the phase of the
temporal response will be constant when
.NE cp
.EQ
alpha
  = { k21 cos ( phase ) + k22 sin ( phase ) }
  / { k11 cos ( phase ) + k12 sin ( phase ) }
.EN
where $alpha$ is the tangent of the temporal phase angle.
If the ratios that define the
relative phase among the numerator and denominator are equal,
that is whenever $k11 / k12 = k21 / k22 = beta$, then
equation \n(cp is satisfied since we can factor out $k22$ from
the numerator and $k12$ from the denominator to find that

.EQ
alpha 
   = {k22 / k12}
     { beta cos ( phase ) + sin ( phase ) }
   / { beta cos ( phase ) + sin ( phase ) }
   = { k22 / k12 } ~~~.
.EN

(Also, the special case in which
$k12 = k22 = 0$, so that $alpha = k21 / k11 $ satisfies \n(cp.)
These conditions on the $k sub {ij}$ 
are satisfied, for example, when the
receptive field has even or odd symmetry in space.
.pp
In this special case,
the relationship between temporal amplitude and spatial phase
can be found by substituting 
the constant phase condition into equation \n(am.

.EQ
amp sup {2} ( phase ) 
  = ( k11 cos ( phase ) + k12 sin ( phase ) ) sup {2}
  + alpha sup {2} (k11 cos ( phase ) + k12 sin ( phase ) ) sup {2}
.EN

which simplifies to

.EQ
amp sup {2} ( phase )
     = ( 1 + alpha sup {2}  ) ( k11 cos ( phase ) + k12 sin ( phase ) ) sup {2}
.EN


.EQ
amp ( phase )
   = sqrt { ( 1 + alpha sup {2} ) } | k11 cos ( phase ) + k12 sin ( phase ) |
.EN

so we find that
the amplitude is a sinusoidal function of spatial phase,
at the same frequency as the spatial component of the
contrast-reversal grating.
(Though we still have to adjust the sign of the amplitude,
which is always positive).
Because retinal ganglion cell receptive fields are typically
even-symmetric, they satisfy one of the possible conditions
that lead to the sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase.

.lh "A special case:  even-symmetric receptive fields"
.pp
Retinal ganglion cells and lateral geniculate neurons
typically have circularly symmetric receptive fields.
The analysis of these cells, therefore, is relatively
simple compared to the general case.
Suppose we label the center of the receptive field
as the zero position.
Then the circular symmetry means that these neurons
have even-symmetry.
When the spatial structure of the receptive field
has even symmetry, then $k12$ and $k22$ will both be
zero and the predicted output as a function of spatial
phase and time will be

.EQ
o ( phase , t ) 
  = k11 cos ( phase ) cos ( t ) + k21 cos ( phase ) sin ( t )
.EN

The only unknown values necessary to predict the neural
response in this case are $k11$ and $k21$.
If we know the receptive field function, $RFmt$, then
we can predict these constants.
Conversely, suppose we make a set of measurements using
contrast-reversal gratings.
When the receptive field has even symmetry, then we can
use the measurements in the
$phase = 0$ to estimate the constants $k11$ and $k12$.
We can use the estimated values of $k11$ and $k12$,
estimated using different spatial frequencies $f sub {x}$,
to compute the receptive field function, $RFmt$, as
a function of space.

Remember that the constants $k11$ and $k21$ are
.in 1.0i

$k11 =   sumtau summu cos ( tau ) cos ( mu ) RFmt $

$k21 =   sumtau summu sin ( tau ) cos ( mu ) RFmt $

.ei



.lh "Final comment"
.pp
As we examine measurements from other neurons, particularly
cortical neurons,
it is important to remember that neither the null
test nor Hochstein and Shapley's improvement
represent a general test of linearity.
Units can be linear and yet fail the null test as well
as the more general test suggested by Hochstein and Shapley.
The best test of linearity is a direct test
of the principle of superposition.
Put in stimulus A, stimulus B, and then the superposition
of A and B.
Don't bother about the stimuli being sinusoids;
do try to make them different from one another.
If there are technical reasons
for using sinusoidal patterns, then
one should evaluate one of the equations for the
more general cases (e.g. equation \n(hs).
