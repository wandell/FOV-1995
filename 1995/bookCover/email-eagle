Dear Prof. Wandell,

I am trying to get hold the numbers describing the human spatiotemporal 
constrats sensitivity function. I'd like to put some motion stimuli I'm using 
through this envelope as a first step to modelling some psychophsyical data.
I notice in your book (which I think is excellent - a modern-day Cornsweet) 
that you have re-plotted a synthesis of Kelly's data (Fig. 7.22). Is the data 
or function you used to produce the figure easily accessible ? I would be 
extrmely grateful if you could e-mail some details of the function you have 
derived, or otherwise how I might go about gettng hold of it. Am I right in 
assuming that the figure was generated in MatLab ? I have access to MatLab 
here, so something in that format would be very useful to me. 

Thanks very much for your time,
Richard Eagle

Dear Brian

Thanks for you quick response. This will be very useful to me. The comments 
will also come in handy, as I'm planning on including several chapters of your 
book in this year's reading lists for my students.

Best wishes,
Richard Eagle
