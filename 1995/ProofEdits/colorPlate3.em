1 In its regenerated form, the rod photopigment rhodopsin appears purple. 
The pigment can be seen in light reflected from the eyes of an alligator 
that had been kept in the dark for several hours (top). After exposure to 
light, rhodopsin bleaches and becomes transparent, so only the reflective 
white tapetum is visible (bottom). From Rushton, 1962.

2 This collage by Josef Albers demonstrates that the results of the color 
matching experiment cannot explain color appearance. Although the light 
reflected from the two "X" shapes have the same spectral power distribution 
(as can be seen at the top of the figure where the X's join) and have the 
same effect on the photopigments, their appearance differs.  Thus, the 
photopigment responses in a small region do not determine color appearance 
in that region; rather, appearance depends on the spatial structure of the 
image as a whole. From Albers, 1975.

3 Our visual experience of color depends on the spatiotemporal frequency 
range of the stimulus. This graph divides the spatiotemporal plane into 
three different regions corresponding to three basic color appearance 
regimes. At low spatiotemporal frequencies (region 3), color perception is 
trichromatic: we perceive blue-yellow, red-green, and light-dark variations 
in contrast. At moderate spatiotemporal frequencies (region 2), color 
perception is dichromatic: we fail to perceive blue-yellow contrast. At high 
spatiotemporal frequencies (region 1), color perception is monochromatic: we 
perceive all image contrast as light-dark modulations of the mean color.

4 Linear-model approximations to the Macbeth ColorChecker are shown rendered 
under a blue-sky illumination; the dimension of each approximation is listed 
above the images. In the one-dimensional approximation, the surfaces appear 
monochromatic, varying only in lightness. As the dimension of the 
linear-model increases, the approximations appear more similar to the 
original. For this illuminant, the rendering is visually indistinguishable 
from the rendering of the surfaces using more than three dimensions in the 
linear model. **I still find the last sentence a bit unclear.**

5 The memory-matching (left) and haploscopic (right) methods for measuring 
asymmetric color matches. In the memory-matching method, the subject sees a 
target under one illumination, remembers its appearance, and then identifies 
a matching target after adapting to a second illumination. In the 
haploscopic method, the observer adapts each eye separately and makes a 
simultaneous appearance match. An important feature of the haploscopic 
apparatus depicted is that the bipartite test field is divided by a 
perpendicular, two-sided mirror that enlarges the size of the background 
presented to each eye. If a black dividing screen is used instead, shifting 
the gaze between right and left visual fields causes significant changes in 
the mean illumination.

6 These two colored squarewave patterns were printed using the same ink, and 
hence the bars reflect the same light towards your eyes. Their color 
appearance differs because they are printed at different spatial 
frequencies. (At many viewing distances, the thin bars on the left appear 
relatively green while the thick bars on the right appear relatively blue). 
You can also influence the color appearance of the bars by modifying the 
temporal frequencies of the two patterns: if you move the book up and down 
rapidly while viewing the patterns they will appear to be different colors. 
>From Wandell, 1993

7 The apparent spatial sharpness, or focus, of a color image depends mainly 
on the light-dark components of the image rather than the opponent-colors 
components. Using a digital representation, the image at top left was 
decomposed into three separate light-dark, red-green, and blue-yellow 
contrast images. Three reproductions of the original were then made by 
blurring each of the three contrast images in turn and then combining them. 
The result of using a blurred light-dark (top right), red-green (bottom 
left), or blue-yellow (bottom right) contrast image are shown. The physical 
defocus of each contrast image prior to recombination was the same, but only 
the reproduction with a blurred light-dark contrast image appears defocused.
