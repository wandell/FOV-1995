Brian:

I was about to send you the original figure legend for Color Plate 7, but 
decided to send a rewrite. Here goes:

The apparent spatial sharpness, or focus, of a color image depends mainly on 
the light-dark components of the image rather than the opponent-colors 
components. The image at top left was altered by blurring only its 
light-dark (top right), red-green (bottom left), or blue-yellow (bottom 
right) components. Although the amount of blurring was the same in all three 
cases, the image with blurred light-dark components looks more defocused 
than the rest.

Here's a rewrite of all the legends. Let me know what you think. I've put 
carets under anything I was unsure about.


1 Rhodopsin, the rod photopigment, is visible as a purple substance in the 
eyes of an alligator that had been kept in the dark for several hours (top). 
After exposure to light, the rhodopsin is bleached, and only the reflective 
white tapetum is visible (bottom). From Rushton, 1962.

2 As this collage by Josef Albers demonstrates, color matching does not 
predict color appearance. Although the color of the two "X" shapes is 
physically the same (as can be seen at the top of the figure where the X's 
join), and thus have the same effect on the photopigments, their appearance 
differs. Photopigment responses at a particular point do not determine color 
appearance at that point; rather, appearance depends on the spatial 
structure of the image as a whole. From Albers, 1975.
                       ^^ ^ ^^^^^
3 Our sensitivity to color and the color appearance of an image are 
influenced by an image's spatiotemporal pattern. We perceive blue-yellow, 
red-green, and light-dark variations at the lowest spatial frequencies. When 
the spatial freqency of a pattern exceeds 3-4 cpd, or the temporal pattern 
exceeds 3-4 Hz, we fail to see blue-yellow variation. At spatial freqencies 
of more than 16 cpd (or temporal patterns exceeding 16Hz) our perception is 
monochromatic: we see an image only as light-dark modulations of the mean 
color. **The figure has three sections; do you want to mention what goes on 
in the middle range?**

4 Linear-model approximations to the Macbeth ColorChecker are shown rendered 
under a blue-sky illumination; the dimension of each approximation is listed 
above the images. In the one-dimensional approximation, the surfaces appear 
monochromatic, varying only in lightness. For this illuminant, the rendering 
is visually indistinguishable from a complete rendering of the surfaces when 
using more than three dimensions in the linear model.

5 The memory-matching (left) and haploscopic (right) methods for measuring 
asymmetric color matches. In the memory-matching method, the subject sees a 
target under one illumination, remembers its appearance, and then identifies 
a matching target after adapting to a second illumination. In the 
haploscopic method, the observer adapts each eye separately and makes a 
simultaneous appearance match. An important feature of the haploscopic 
apparatus is that the bipartite test field is divided by a perpendicular, 
two-sided mirror, which allows the subject to move their eyes over the 
fields without causing the change in illumination that a black dividing 
screen would cause.

6 The blue and yellow bars in both patterns are the same color. However, 
their appearance is determined by their spatial frequency, which you can 
change by viewing the patterns from a distance or by moving the book up and 
down rapidly while viewing the patterns. From Wandell, 1993. **Or is the 
second _spatiotemporal_?**

7 The apparent spatial sharpness, or focus, of a color image depends mainly 
on the light-dark components of the image rather than the opponent-colors 
components. The image at top left was altered by blurring only its 
light-dark (top right), red-green (bottom left), or blue-yellow (bottom 
right) components. Although the amount of blurring was the same in all three 
cases, the image with blurred light-dark components looks more defocused 
than the rest. Courtesy of Helgit Hel-Or.
