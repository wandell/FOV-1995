\section*{Proofs, Figure 5.26 caption}

{\bf Peter: Please insert this sentence into the caption of Fig 5.26.
It would be nice if we had the symbol in the caption rather than the
word description.}

The four contrast sensitivity functions were measured on backgrounds
with mean intensities: (open squares) $16$, (filled squares) $16
\times 10^{-2}$, (open circles) $16 \times 10^{-4}$, and (filled
circles) $16 \times 10{-6}$ candelas per meter squared $(cd /m^2)$.
