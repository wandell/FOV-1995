Recall that the receptive fields of neurons in the early part of the visual
pathway have modest size receptive fields.
The neuron's receptive field acts as an aperture.
The part of an image within the receptive field
will often be nearly one-dimensional, implying
that each sensor will have ambiguous information about
the direction of motion.
We can think of the information at a neuron
the direction of motion.
We can think of the information at a neuron
as determining a constraint line.
The intersection-of-constrains suggests how
to combine the outputs of many sensors.
We collect the constraint lines into a single representation;
their intersection identifies the
direction of motion of a rigid, translating, object.
