Brian:

I've read over the motion chapter from your book, and I think it's
pretty good. There are one or two issues about which I have questions
(several of them organizational), but in general I like the material
and the approach.

I have two main comments on organization, which relate to sections
that I think are intrusive. One is section 1.2.4, on depth and
random-dot stereograms. While you can (and do) draw the parallels
between motion and stereo, the link is not really very tightly made
and as a result the section seems out of place. I presume that it must
also replicate material from another chapter elsewhere on stereo.
Surely it would be better just to cover motion and stereo separately,
and then have a section somewhere (I would have thought in the stereo
chapter) comparing and contrasting stereo and motion cues to depth?
Now there may not be a separate stereo chapter, in which case section
1.2.4 is really too slender and lacking analysis to stand alone as
your treatment. Better in this case to leave it out altogther than to
do have a job.
   The second concerns the material on recovery from early blindness
(1.3.1). Really, this material has very little specifically to do with
motion perception, and much more to do with form vision. You make a
weak case somewhere for motion being particularly susceptible to
disruption because of the need for comparisons over space and time,
but I don't find that convincing and moreover there's no empirical
evidence for it that I know of. Again, this stuff seems out of place
in this chapter.

More specific comments:

p 6. Purkinje (1825) is usually cited as the first modern report of
the MAE.

p 9. The statement that 60 Hz is good enough should except the rapid
moevement of small objects, and refer forward to the section on the
window of visibility.

p 10. Last paragraph, the notion that " ... the difference is larger
for faster moving targets ... " seems fuzzy to me. What is larger,
exactly?

p 11. Although he didn't get it all, there's a Morgan paper from the
early '80s that is the first to have the kernel of the w-o-v idea. I
can dig up the reference if you don't know which one I mean.

p 11-13. I think there's a problem with your treatment of the w-o-v.
Essentially, you treat the spatio-temporal replicas without making
clear that they are really *temporal* replicas produced by *temporal
sampling*. The decisive case for this is to consider the effects of
sampling on faster and faster movement. The slopes of the spectra get
steeper and steeper, but their separation is maintained only in the y
direction. As a result, the replicas close in on the w-o-v,
corresponding to the visibility of aliases of rapidly moving targets
even at very high sampling rates. This could be clarified by showing a
family of replicas for targets of different speeds. This would also
allow you to clarify that a display system is useful up to a
particular stimulus speed and not beyond. (This is of course too
simple because the problem can be attenuated by low-pass spatial
filtering, but you get the drift).

p 18. (You guessed it!). Why bother with the matrix representation
when the graphical one is so clear?

p 20. The paragraphs at the top of the page are a little opaque,
because you haven't given the reader any intuition (graphical or
otherwise) of the contribution of an object's depth to the resulting
flow field.

p 21. A simple figure contrasting efference copy (not *efferent* copy,
usually, by the way) with inflow theories would be helpful.

p 22. I think you've got saccadic suppression wrong. Ross and Burr
showed that ss is best understood as the reduction in visibility
associated with moving a contrast target very rapidly. Very low
spatial frequency targets are visible at high speeds, and during
saccades. I think the evidence for any specific central gating of
visual signals during saccades is pretty weak.

p 23. I think you need to do better with the head movement section.
Head movements do not in general give rise to rapid retinal image
motion, and would therefore not be expected to cause suppression.

p 33. The middle paragraph is weakly argued.

Otherwise, it's fine. I think you did a nice compact job with the
physiology.
