I'd like to understand the current concensus about the suitability of the 2D
Gabor function model of simple cell receptive fields, and I hope that someone
on this list can steer me in the right direction.

Marcelja (1980) and Daugman (1980, 1983) appear to have been among the first
to suggest that the receptive fields (RF) of cortical simple cells might be
well described by a Gabor function.  Many results seem to be consistent with
this view, and many studies that I've read in psychophysics and visual
neuroscience make use of this general model.  An impressive set of studies by
Jones and Palmer showed that a general 2D Gabor function can very closely
match the RF profile of simple cells (Jones and Palmer, 1987a, 1987b; Jones,
Stepnoski and Palmer, 1987).  However, there have been dissenting views; for
example, Stork and Wilson (1990) argued that the Gabor function model is not
well supported.  Daugman (1993) in turn argued that Stork and Wilson (1990),
and others, were in error.

I'd like to find out whether this argument has been resolved, and in which
direction.  If it hasn't been resolved, which way are people leaning
currently?
