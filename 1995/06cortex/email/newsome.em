1)  Receptive field mechanics is not one of my strong points.
People like Ralph, Tony and Bob Shapley may have strong ideas
about frequency doubling, but it is not a subject I care deeply
about.  I simply have the intuition that if a complex cell gives
excitatory responses to single spots both at light on and light
off, then it makes sense that it should respond to both phases
of a sinusoid as well.  

2)  I have nagging doubts about the people in Tony's lab who do
the correlation of physiology with CO patterns.  I don't actually
know, in fact, who does it.  I am sure that Tony doesn't.  It is
a tricky business, and one must be compulsively careful about it.
Hubel & Co. have a much better record on this point than the Movshon
lab.  I guess I am somewhat agnostic at this point, but if I had
to place bets, I would lean more toward Hubel.  

3)  I agree that the alternating deprivation paradigm is the best
way to get at the role of binocular cells in stereopsis.  You will
note the email that I sent to Tony and Lynne.  If nothing good
emerges, you might simply note that humans with abnormal visual
experience during the critical period have permanent deficits in
stereopsis (this is why ophthalmologists do corrective surgery
early on).  These conditions are similar to those that lead to
destruction of binocular connections in experimental animals, but
we do not yet have firm physiological and behavioral data in a 
single species.  I will be surprised if the animal behavior is
indeed so murky; this is something that should have been addressed
carefully.

Cheers,
Bill

I'm surprised that there are no satisfactory behavioral data
in monkeys.  Shocked is more like it.  Given the prominence of
this whole story in justifying the usefulness of basic research
for prevention of blindness, I would think NEI would want to 
see this whole story documented up the wazoo.  I suppose someone
needs to do the sort of behavior-followed-by-physiology that you
guys did for the amblyopic monkeys.  Seems like a natural for Lynne
and a grad student or postdoc.

I disagree strongly about MT/V5, but I think we may have had this
conversation before.  It is ringing bells.  Your dissatisfaction
with MT on topological grounds seems irrelevant.  Neuroanatomy is
brimming with examples of whimsically, or even inappropriately,
named structures.  Any name can and will be criticized on some 
grounds; none is perfect.  The important thing is clarity and
consistency in usage.  Once a name has been introduced and used
widely, it should be changed only for compelling reasons.  A
secondary but important consideration is that structures that are
obviously homologous across species should have the same name.  We
shouldn't ask students or nonspecialists to master a different 
neuroanatomical language for each species unless the species actually
differ in the structure of their brains.  

V5 fails on both grounds.  In the late 70's it became obvious that
there was more than one motion area in the STS, so Zeki's original
name for MT became hopeless.  At the same time it became clear that
Zeki's motion area was indeed the same structure as MT in the owl
monkey.  Van Essen was the first to face this difficulty square on
in the '81 JCN paper.  He was presenting evidence for two motion
areas in the STS, so he had to abandon "the motion area".  He could
either come up with a new name, or follow the usage already established
in another primate species.  Admirably, I think, he spared us the curse
of yet another new name for a known structure, and fell into line 
behind Allman and Kaas.  This was a conservative and entirely 
appropriate choice.  It was predictable, I suppose, that Zeki's ego
could never handle this, so he had to coin V5 a few years later.  I
object strenuously to this sort of ego-based injection of noise into
neuroanatomical nomenclature.  He thinly disguised his decision as
one of principal, arguing along the topological grounds you outline.
But this doesn't wash because V5 has even greater problems of principle,
owing to the serial model implicit in this naming scheme.  The problem
of principle with V5 is, in fact, a conceptual and scientific problem;
the problem of principle with MT is only topological and thus much
less vexing to me.  Thus I have little sympathy for your point of
view on this issue.  As a service to readers, I am willing to identify
MT as V5 once per manuscript, but I consider the whole issue to be
yet another curse foisted up the field by Zeki.  The great man's
legacy...

By the way, there is much more justification for renaming cat V1
than for renaming macaque MT.  Cat striate cortex differs demonstrably
from monkeys in its connections to the thalamus and to the rest of
extrastriate cortex.  These connectional differences have know 
functional correlates.  I am surprised that you want to use different
nomenclature for macaque and owl monkey MT while retaining the same
nomenclature across species for V1.

1) Hmmmm.  I wasn't aware of the strabismus problems in the alter-
nating deprivation paradigm.  My wife had strabismus as a child,
lacks stereopsis, and has no amblyopia.  She is an alternating 
fixator.  She has no trace of her eye alignment problem, having
had an excellent surgical correction.  If we could get 4 or 5 monkeys
like her, the study would be worthwhile.  By the way, monkeys do
stero discriminations just fine in Schiller's odd-man-out paradigm.
They simply pick out the one patch that has crossed disparity when
all the others have uncrossed (or vice versa).  I dislike his paradigm
when he is testing for *topographically localized* deficits, but it
should be just fine for testing a pan-visual field deficit like
stereopsis after developmental manipulations.

2) I the probability of finding truely substantive functional 
differences between owl monkey and macaque MT is about the same
as finding substantive differences between owl monkey and macaque
cerebellum.  Are we going to rename the cerebellum in the macaque
as well?
