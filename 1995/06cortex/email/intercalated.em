Brian,
	I sent this message to you last week, but it was
returned to me over the weekend.

Brian,
      You can see them in standard sections, but you have to
look real hard.  The cells are small and few in number.  The 
intercalated layers are "gossamer thin" in Hubel's words.  Alan
Cowey has been interested in them from a blind-sight point of 
view since they seem to project in part to extrastriate cortex.
David Fitzpatrick has produced evidence that they project 
directly to the blobs in striate cortex, and Hendry has apparently
confirmed that.  Hendry has a recent paper in Science (within the
last month - 22 April, actually) that probably contains relevant
references.  I passes your query along to Rick Born who knows 
this literature better than I do...

Bill

Brian,
Bill forwarded me your questions thinking that I was better equipped to
answer them.  I say he's just lazy, or, worse yet, yeller.  Here goes.

The reason you've never heard of the interlaminar zones (a.k.a. interlaminar
leaflets, a.k.a. intercalated layers) is because you are not a true LGB
afficionado.  Peole have talked about them, just not that much, because
these layers are thin, and, though visible on ordinary histological sections
not terribly impressive to the eye.  Also, because these layers are so thin
physiologists never really know when we're recording from their cells.  (A
similar problem exists for layer 4A of striate cortex).  The recent excitement
over the Hendry & Yoshioka Science paper (vol. 264, pp. 575-7) is due to the
fact, in part, that they can now stain these neurons specifically with an
antibody (to the alpha subunit of type II CamKinase; go figure).  Suddenly,
they look impressive--like a bonafide population.  Even before this, however,
the basic ideas of a direct projection from the intercalated layers to the
blobs was pretty well established, though not as cleanly.  The first to do
it was David Fitzpatrick, workin on the tree shrew (probably part of the reason
not much excitement ensued).  More recently Vivian Casagrande's group has
done corresponding anatomy experiments in both new and old world monkeys.
As for physiology, the story is murkier, due mostly to the reason I gave above.
For the past couple of years, Marge Livingstone has been saying that she thinks
the third (color) processing stream originates in the geniculate intercalated
layers.  This was based, in part, on the anatomy, but also on some physiology:
She and David Hubel went back and looked at the notes from the Hubel and 
Wiesel geniculate days and found that most of the type II cells (color opponent,
center only) were near eye transitions in the dorsal layers, hence likely
to be near to the interlaminar zones.

I've rambled on enough.  If you want to read more, start with the Hendry
Science paper.  All of the references that I've mentioned above are cited
therein.  Good luck and don't hesistate to send along more questions--to
Bill.

Rick


Hope it gets through.
Best,
Rick

Brian,
Just got your message.
You are already pushing my memory of LGN anatomy.  If you want the definitive
facts in written form, consult Fitzpatrick et al., J. Neurosci. 3(4):673-702.
Here's my capsule summary:
The layers issue depends on species and investigator.  Fitzpatrick , working
in the squirrel monkey, uses the term to apply to 2 layers: one on either side
of the 2 magno layers.  He also refers to the macaque literature as putting
them surrounding only the magno layers.  The intercalated layers in prosimians
lie between the parvocellular layers.  Hendry and Yoshioka, however, clearly
want us to think of these cells as lying between all layers of the macaque
LGN, including ventral to layer 1 and dorsal to layer 6 (even though they
say they have adopted the terminology of Fitzpatrick et al.).  Thus, it 
seems like there's a real difference of opinion.  This can probably be 
easily resolved.  Fitzpatrick lays out 4 criteria for definining these cells:
1. distinct cell size 2. finer caliber of retinal terminals compared to both
magno and parvo, 3. receive a projection from the superficial layers of the 
superior colliculus, and 4. project directly to superficial layers of
striate cortex.  Hendry and Yoshioka have clearly shown that what they
stain with their antibody meets criterion #4.  If the other 3 were also
met, I don't think anyone would argue about finding them between the dorsal
layers in the macaque.  I do note, however, that in the pictures in their
Science paper (fig. 1), the majority of CaMII Kinase-positive cells are 
between layers 2 & 3 and ventral to layer 1--the "classic" definition of
Fitzpatrick and others before him.

As for eye inputs:  Fitzpatrick found that the layer ventral to layer 1 
received input exclusively from the contralateral eye.  The layer between
layers 2&3 could be subdivided: the sublayer closest to layer 2 received
input from the ipsilateral retina; the sublayer closest to layer 3 got input
from the contralateral eye.

Hope this is useful.

Rick
