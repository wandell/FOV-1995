Yes.  It was our preliminary finding that, in Owl monkey (nocturnal,
new world monkey, rod-dominated retina, only rudimentary color vision),
neurons within and between blobs had similar spatial and temporal
tuning.  We did not find that neurons in blobs lacked orientation
selectivity.

There is not a paper yet.  We attempted another series of recordings
after this year's ARVO meetings to finish off the experiments, but,
unfortunately, the recordings did not go well.  I'm not sure what we
are going to do about that... presumably try again, but I don't know
when.

The only recent reference I know of is a Leventhal talk at ARVO from
the same year as ours, where he recorded orientation and (I think)
spatial frequency tuning for neurons within and between blobs in V1 of
macaque monkeys.  My recollection was that he found little/no
difference in tuning.  However, my feeling is that he has an axe to
grind- he is a proponent of the view that LGN neruons are orientation-
tuned, and that the orientation tuning in V1 is more or less a
sharpening of the tuning already present in the LGN.  The point is that
I don't think he will ever say that a neuron lacks tuning.  

Here is the reference to our ARVO abstract:
O'Keefe, L.P., Levitt, J.B., Kiper, D.C., Shapley, R.M. and Movshon,
J.A. (1993).  Functional organization of owl monkey LGN and visual
cortex. Invest.  Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., 34(4)(suppl.), 907.

Hope this helps.

Larry
