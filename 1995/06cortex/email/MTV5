A textbook on visual neuroscience? -- a bold and thankless
task I should think.

The best name is, of couse, the one that carries the most
information.  The weight of history thus favors "MT", and
unequivocally so.  Arguments based on information about
hierarchical status potentially conveyed by "V5" are flawed
and such labels are, in consequence, not merely useless but
misleading.  Arguments based upon similarity of orthographic
form are silly and come from people without spine or inspiration
(these people would doubtless have us rename the planets P1, P2,
P3...). 
But the thing that I find most disruptive and frustrating is the use
of namby-pamby, waffling labels like "MT/V5" or "MT (V5)".  Let's just
give it a proper name and be done with it. (good luck)

No, but I use MT and I tend to read strong statements when someone
else uses the V5 designation.  We tend to talk about MT and make
parenthetical reference to V5.  If someone refers to V5 I view it as
a statement in support of Zeki, whereas the designation MT insults no
one except Zeki (when applied to old world monkeys).

Interesting.  He comes on even stronger than I would.  
Forward it to Tony...

Nomenclature for extrastriate visual areas is a ridiculous problem.
Objectively, V5 is sensible, but MT has precedence. There is really no
sense to the naming of area. Following is a figure legend I once wrote
to try to help the naive reader with this mess. It doesn't.

The abbreviations used for the names of areas in this figure
and  figure  5  are based partly on beliefs about the serial
order of visual processing (V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4), partly  on
old  architectural  maps of the cerebral cortex (7a, 8, TF),
and partly on geographical location in the cerebral  cortex.
For  names  of this last kind, the abbreviations are as fol-
lows: PO, parieto-occipital area; DP, dorsal prelunate area;
VIP,  ventral intraparietal area; LIP, lateral intraparietal
area; MT, middle temporal area; MST,  medial  superior  tem-
poral  area;  STP,  superior  temporal polysensory area; VP,
ventral posterior area; VA, ventral anterior area; PIT, pos-
terior  inferior  temporal area; AIT, anterior inferior tem-
poral area; PS, prostriate area. To make matters  even  more
confusing,  three  of  these ``geographical'' names - MT, VP
and VA - are derived from the positions of the areas in  the
brain  of the owl monkey, which is rather different from the
brain of the macaque.

I think Semir Zeki is the principal hold-out for V5.  Almost everybody
else uses MT, and I'm all for surrendering to the majority when it comes
to terminology.

There's anothe reason too.  The V1...Vn scheme implies (though not strongly)
a hierarchy.  We don't know it it's legitimate beyond V2.
