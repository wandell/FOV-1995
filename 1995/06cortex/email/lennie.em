Having read it carefully, I'm not terribly excited. The "large population"
must be less than 1/4 that of magno, judging by the volume of LGN labelled,
so that puts the number of cells at ~3%.  The notion that they have W-like
properties seems to have been plucked from nowhere.

I think it would be interesting to look at them carefully, but I doubt that
anyone's going to end up talking about a major new stream.

I agree in principle about the significance of numbers.  Remember also that
no-one's found what the M-pathway is important for.
