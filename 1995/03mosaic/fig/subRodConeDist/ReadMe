The sConeDensity data were scanned from Curcio et al., 1991
Fig 8 and red in via Data thief
The original x axis is mm and the Y axis is bluecones per
squared mm.

Data stolen from file: S cone density
The X-axis is linear from 0 to 2
The Y-axis is linear from 0 to 4000

The file sDensity was created using makeSDensity.m, and it
(a) converts to deg,mm^2
(b) extends so that s cone data are 7 percent out to a reasonable
eccentricity.
