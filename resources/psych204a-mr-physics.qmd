##  B0 field
You're right, the B0 field in an MRI scanner is generated by a strong current flowing through superconducting coils. Here's a breakdown of the relationship between electric and magnetic fields in this context:

* **Current and Magnetic Fields:**
    * **Fundamental Principle:** Moving electric charges (like the current in the superconducting coils) always produce a magnetic field. This is a fundamental law of electromagnetism. 
    * **Direction:** The direction of the magnetic field is determined by the direction of the current flow (right-hand rule).

* **Current and Electric Fields (in a Wire):**
    * **Static Current:** When a steady current flows through a conductor (like the MRI coils), there's a very small electric field within the conductor itself. This field is necessary to maintain the current flow against any resistance. However, this internal electric field is generally not a significant factor in the overall operation of the MRI.
    * **Changing Current:** If the current in the coils were to change rapidly (which it does during the scanning process), this would induce an electromotive force (EMF) within the coils themselves. This EMF, according to Faraday's Law of Induction, would then create an electric field.

* **Frequency of the Electric Field:**
    * **DC Current (Ideally):** The B0 field is ideally generated by a constant (DC) current. In this ideal scenario, there would be no significant changes in the current, and therefore no significant time-varying electric field. 
    * **Practical Considerations:** In reality, there might be slight fluctuations in the current even in a superconducting magnet. These fluctuations could induce small, low-frequency electric fields. However, these are typically negligible for the operation of the MRI.

**Key Points:**

* The primary focus in an MRI scanner is the **magnetic field (B0)** generated by the current in the superconducting coils.
* The electric field associated with the steady current in the coils is generally minimal and not a major concern for MRI operation.
* Rapid changes in current (which occur during specific scanning sequences) can induce time-varying electric fields, but these are typically well-controlled and minimized.

**Disclaimer:** This is a simplified explanation. The actual electromagnetic field environment within an MRI scanner is complex and involves various other factors, including the radiofrequency (RF) pulses used for imaging.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like to delve deeper into any specific aspect of MRI physics.

**Yet, when we think of the electromagnetic spectrum, we think of electromagnetic waves, such as light or radio waves. If the current is steady (DC) does that mean that there is no electromagnetic wave needed to produce the magnetic field?

You're hitting on a crucial point! 

* **Steady Current and Electromagnetic Waves:**

    * A **steady DC current** itself **does not directly produce electromagnetic waves**. 
        * Electromagnetic waves require **changing electric and magnetic fields**. 
        * In a steady DC current, the electric and magnetic fields are constant, not oscillating.

* **Magnetic Field from DC Current:**

    * While a steady DC current doesn't produce electromagnetic waves, it **does generate a static magnetic field**. 
        * This static magnetic field is crucial for the B0 field in an MRI scanner.

* **Key Distinction:**

    * **Electromagnetic waves** are **propagating disturbances** in the electromagnetic field that travel through space. 
    * The **static magnetic field** around a DC current is a **localized field** that doesn't propagate as a wave.

**Analogy:**

* Imagine a pond. 
    * Throwing a rock into the pond creates **waves** that travel outwards. 
    * Placing a heavy object in the middle of the pond creates a **disturbance in the water** (a depression), but it doesn't create waves that propagate.

**In Summary:**

The B0 field in an MRI scanner is generated by a **static magnetic field** produced by a steady DC current. While this current doesn't produce electromagnetic waves itself, it's essential for establishing the strong magnetic field necessary for MRI imaging.

I hope this clarifies the relationship between DC current, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic waves!
